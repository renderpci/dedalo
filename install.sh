# Dédalo v7 — guided one-command install (containers).
#
# Operator guide: docs/install/quickstart.md
#
# Asks the questions the installer needs, then gets the image, starts
# PostgreSQL, runs the headless installer and brings the stack up. When it
# finishes, Dédalo is installed and you log in — there is no browser wizard and
# therefore no unauthenticated install surface at any point.
#
# WHERE THE IMAGE COMES FROM is a question, asked right after the TLS one: one
# of Dédalo's official registries (deploy/image_registries.sh, generated from
# engineering/image_registries.json — primary first, then the mirrors, each
# probed for this checkout's version), a registry of your own, or a build here
# from this checkout (deploy/compose.build.yml). The default is the first
# official registry that publishes this version, else the local build. The
# answer is written to .dedalo.env (DEDALO_IMAGE, DEDALO_VERSION pinned,
# DEDALO_IMAGE_MODE, DEDALO_IMAGE_VERIFY, DEDALO_COMPOSE_FILE), and every later
# update — deploy/dedalo-image-update.sh, by hand or through the opt-in host
# updater — takes its image from the same place. The decisions shared with
# those tools live in deploy/dedalo-image-lib.sh.
#
# It drives docker-compose.simple.yml, which trades TLS and media access control
# away for simplicity. Read that file's header before using this on anything but
# a machine your own network reaches. For the full production stack, follow
# docs/install/docker.md instead — nothing here replaces it.
#
# Re-running is refused once the instance exists: the seed restore requires an
# empty database, so a second install is never a repair.
