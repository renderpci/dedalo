A field that links records — a portal, a select, a check box, a list of informants — holds
links, and links have no language, even when the field's definition is marked translatable.
Its [time machine](./tools/using_time_machine.md) history is now always one timeline: every
change is one entry holding the whole field and its dataframe frames, shown in the history of
every language, and restoring it or reverting a batch run puts back exactly that field,
whichever language you work in. Before, such a field marked translatable filed each change
under the language of the page that saved it. Language entries remain for text fields. Older entries a
previous version filed under a language are part of the same timeline and are listed in every
language too. The time machine no longer offers a language choice for such a field, and its
restore confirmation says the whole field is replaced.
