# sections

The plural **collection concept**: given a search query (an SQO) or a set of
locators, resolve the matching records of a `section_tipo`, enumerate their
`section_id`s, and perform bulk deletes. It answers *"which records of this
section exist?"* — not the one that reads or writes a single record.

> See also: [Sections concept](index.md) · [section](section.md) · [section_record](section_record.md) · [Components](../components/index.md)

There is **no `sections` object to instance**. The *contract* — the envelope
shape and the SQO-normalization rules — is a pure spec in
`src/core/concepts/sections.ts`; the actual search → rows → per-record fan-out
is a set of plain async functions in `src/core/section/read.ts` (`readSection`,
`readSectionRows`, `deriveSectionDdoMap`). A caller just calls the function with
an `Rqo`.

## Role

Where the [section concept doc](index.md) explains the matrix-table model — a
logical record is the pair `(section_tipo, section_id)`, and all records of
every section live in one `matrix` table — the `sections` concept operates over
the **collection** of records that share a `section_tipo`. It does not own a
record's data or its database I/O; it runs a search and hands back the result.

Three sibling concepts share the "section" name and are easy to confuse. Keep
the distinction crisp:

| concept | scope | owns | typical job | module home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`section`** (singular) | one section *type* (one `section_tipo`) | the table abstraction: components, permissions, the shared `relations` array | build a section's context, resolve its children | `src/core/concepts/section.ts`, `src/core/section/context.ts` |
| **`section_record`** | one record *row* `(section_tipo, section_id)` | the physical per-record I/O (read / save / delete / duplicate) | load, persist or delete a single row in `matrix` | `src/core/concepts/section_record.ts`, `src/core/section_record/`, `src/core/section/record/` |
| **`sections`** (plural — *this concept*) | the *collection* of records of a `section_tipo` | nothing persistent; it runs a search over the matrix | list the `section_id`s, fetch list data, bulk-delete records matching a query | `src/core/concepts/sections.ts`, `src/core/section/read.ts` |

In short: `section` is the type, `section_record` is one row, and `sections` is
"the set of rows". `sections` never touches a column directly — it delegates
reads to the [search / SQO](../sqo.md) machinery and per-record deletes to the
`section_record` write path.

## The SQO-normalization contract

`src/core/concepts/sections.ts` is the pure-contract home for two rules:

- **SQO cloning + limit defaulting.** The caller's SQO is never mutated in
  place. `limit` defaults to `SECTIONS_EDIT_LIMIT = 1` in edit mode, otherwise
  to `SECTIONS_DEFAULT_LIMIT = 10` unless the caller section's own
  `request_config` supplies one. `select` is forced to `[]` so the search
  returns only `(section_tipo, section_id)` — every value resolves later, per
  record, through the structure-context/subdatum machinery. The engine applies
  this in `readSectionRows()` (`src/core/section/read.ts`): see the
  `clientLimitMissing` handling there.
- **Envelope shape.** The `data[]` array leads with one envelope item
  `{typo:'sections', tipo, section_tipo:[], entries:[...]}`
  (`SECTIONS_ENVELOPE_TYPO = 'sections'`). Each entry is a locator carrying
  `paginated_key = row_index + sqo.offset`. An empty result still emits this
  envelope (context only, no crash).

```ts
// src/core/concepts/sections.ts
export const SECTIONS_DEFAULT_LIMIT = 10;
export const SECTIONS_EDIT_LIMIT = 1;
export const SECTIONS_ENVELOPE_TYPO = 'sections';
```

## The engine — `src/core/section/read.ts`

| function | purpose / returns |
| --- | --- |
| `readSection(rqo, principal?)` | The full read: `context[]` (deduplicated by `contextKey`, first occurrence wins) plus `data[]` (the `sections` envelope followed by one item per resolved component ddo, record-major/ddo-minor). The single entry point for both `list` and `edit` reads. |
| `readSectionRows(rqo, principal?)` | Runs the SQO through the search engine (`pickReadSource` → the matrix source or the Time Machine `tm` source), builds the envelope, and drives the per-row/per-ddo emission (`emitDdoData`). |
| `deriveSectionDdoMap(sectionTipo, ownerSectionTipo, mode)` | When the client sends no `show.ddo_map`, derive the section's default columns from its ontology `request_config` (the v5/v6 builders). |

There is no shared "enumerate every matching `section_id`, ignoring pagination"
helper. A caller that needs one (limit `0`, offset `0`, `full_count = false`,
`select = []`) builds its own no-limit search over `buildSearchSql`
(`src/core/search/sql_assembler.ts`) — `tools/tool_update_cache` is the worked
example.

## Bulk delete — the `delete` API action

The `delete` action handler (`src/core/api/handlers/dd_core_api.ts`) is the
API's single delete entry point, for both one record and an SQO-matched set:

```ts
// the 'delete' action (essence)
const sectionTipo = source.section_tipo ?? source.tipo;
const deleteMode = source.delete_mode ?? 'delete_data'; // the default
// ... permission gate, area-write refusal ...
const targets = source.section_id !== undefined
  ? [Number(source.section_id)]
  : /* SQO-matched ids, global-admin only */ matchedIds;
for (const targetId of targets) {
  const outcome = deleteMode === 'delete_record'
    ? await deleteSectionRecord(sectionTipo, targetId, principal.userId)
    : await deleteSectionData(sectionTipo, targetId, principal.userId);
}
```

Its guarantees, in the order they are enforced:

- **Permissions.** Requires `getPermissions(sectionTipo, sectionTipo) >= 2`;
  refused otherwise.
- **Per-record scope gate.** A non-global-admin deleting an explicit
  `section_id` must have that record inside their projects filter
  (`isRecordInScope()`, `src/core/security/record_scope.ts`). Without this, a
  level-2 user could delete a record they can never see — a cross-project IDOR.
  Global admins are unscoped.
- **Multiple-delete guard.** An SQO-based (rather than explicit-id) delete
  requires `principal.isGlobalAdmin`, and fails closed.
- **Cross-section leak guard.** When deleting from an SQO, matched rows are
  filtered back down to the gated `sectionTipo` before any delete runs.
- **Ontology cascade.** Deleting a `hierarchy1`/`ontology35` registry record
  (`ONTOLOGY_MAIN_SECTIONS`, `src/core/ontology/ontology_delete.ts`) in
  `delete_record` mode **uninstalls its whole TLD** — every `dd_ontology` node,
  the main record, and every node record. Global-admin only, matching the blast
  radius.
- **`delete_mode`** chooses the per-record operation: `delete_record` calls
  `deleteSectionRecord()` (full removal, Time-Machine-backed — see
  [`section_record`](section_record.md)); `delete_data` (the default) calls
  `deleteSectionData()` (clears the data, keeps the row).

!!! warning "A parent with children is skipped, not orphaned"
    A `delete_record` on a tree/thesaurus record that still has
    `component_relation_children` is **refused for that record**: it is skipped
    and its child ids are enumerated back in the response errors, so the subtree
    is never orphaned. The check uses the *computed* inverse children lookup, not
    a stored value.

    Pass `options.delete_with_children` to bypass it deliberately. It never
    applies in `delete_data` mode (which empties the row but keeps it, so nothing
    can be orphaned), and it does not block the ontology cascade above — that
    path legitimately tears down whole trees.

## When it is used

Reach for the `sections` concept (`readSection`/`readSectionRows`, or the
`delete` action) when you are working with **the set of records of a
section_tipo**, not a single one:

- **List mode / search results.** The `dd_core_api.read` action, for a `list`
  or `tm` mode read, calls `readSection()` with the client's navigation SQO;
  the returned `{context, data}` envelope is what the client list view
  ([`section_list`](section_list.md)) renders.
- **Enumerating / iterating every record.** When a tool needs every matching
  `section_id` (e.g. to loop and re-save each), build a no-limit search over
  `buildSearchSql` directly (see `tool_update_cache`) rather than paginating.
- **Bulk delete.** The `delete` API action is the single chokepoint for
  permission checks, the scope and multiple-delete guards, the children
  refusal, and ontology coherence — whether the caller passes one `section_id`
  or an SQO matching many.

Use the singular **[`section`](section.md)** instead when you need one section
*type*'s context, permissions, or buttons, and
**[`section_record`](section_record.md)** when you need to read, save or delete
one specific row. The `sections` collection concept is the wrong tool for
editing a single record: it only locates and bulk-removes.

## Examples

### Read a list page

```ts
import { readSection } from '../section/read.ts';

const result = await readSection(
  {
    action: 'search',
    source: { tipo: 'oh1', section_tipo: 'oh1', mode: 'list', lang: 'lg-spa' },
    sqo: { section_tipo: ['oh1'], limit: 10, offset: 0 },
  },
  principal,
);

// result.data[0] → { typo: 'sections', tipo: 'oh1', section_tipo: [], entries: [...] }
// result.data[1…] → one item per resolved component ddo, per record
```

### Bulk delete a set of records

```ts
// via the API 'delete' action — sqo-matched deletes require a global-admin
// principal; a single explicit section_id does not.
const rqo = {
  action: 'delete',
  source: { section_tipo: 'oh1', delete_mode: 'delete_record' },
  sqo: { section_tipo: ['oh1'], filter_by_locators: [{ section_tipo: 'oh1', section_id: '127' }] },
};
// → { result: ['127'], msg: 'OK. Request done' }
```
