!!! note "Typology"
    `component_check_box` is a **related** component. It does not own literal data; it stores an array of [locator](../locator.md) objects pointing at records of a target *list-of-values* section. It is **not translatable** (`lg-nolan`): the relation is language-independent and the displayed labels are resolved from the target term in the application language.

!!! info "About `default_tools`"
    The toolbar is assembled from the model + ontology, never hardcoded. The set above is what a typical related instance receives in `context.tools`. `component_check_box` is rendered with a fixed, closed option list, so it does not carry an autocomplete/search picker the way `component_portal` does; the inline reset/list buttons (see *Render views & modes*) are built by the render layer, not by tools.

!!! info "TS server implementation"
    The descriptor `src/core/components/component_check_box/descriptor.ts` registers `resolveData: selectFamilyResolver` (`src/core/relations/models/select_family.ts`), shared with `component_select` / `component_select_lang` / `component_radio_button` / `component_publication` / `component_relation_model`. `list`/`edit`/`search` modes build the datalist / label strings through `src/core/relations/datalist.ts`; other modes fall through to the shared portal engine (`src/core/relations/models/portal.ts`). See the *dedalo-relations-ts* skill.

## Definition

`component_check_box` manages a **closed list of values** as a multi-select of checkboxes. It is a related component: each checked option is stored as a locator pointing at a record in a target section (typically a small *list of values* / thesaurus section), and the rendered label is resolved from that target term. The component is non-translatable and can hold multiple selected values at once.

**Why it exists.** Many catalogue fields are constrained to a fixed, short vocabulary where the cataloguer should *see all the options at once* and tick the ones that apply, rather than typing or searching. `component_check_box` renders the whole option list inline as checkboxes, which makes it ideal for small controlled vocabularies and for many-to-many flags. It reuses the shared relation machinery (locators, the section-wide `relations` bag, `from_component_tipo` filtering, Time Machine, diffusion), so the stored data is a normal relation that can be queried from search and exported like any other related component.

**When to use it.**

- A small closed vocabulary where every option should be visible and tickable: *Acquisition type* (purchase / donation / bequest / exchange), *Conservation state*, *Material* flags, *Yes/No* style booleans backed by a list section.
- Many-to-many assignments against a short list: assigning *tools* to a user profile (the security-tools profiles field, see *Notes*), enabling a set of features, tagging a record with several non-hierarchical categories.

**When not to use it.**

- A vocabulary too large to show all at once, or one the user should type/search -> use [component_portal](component_portal.md) (autocomplete behaviour), or `component_select` for a dropdown.
- A single mutually-exclusive choice -> use `component_radio_button`.
- A free relation to arbitrary records of another section (people, places, bibliography) rather than a closed value list -> use [component_portal](component_portal.md).
- A hierarchical parent/child relation in the thesaurus tree -> use `component_relation_parent` / `component_relation_children`.

## Data model

**Data:** `array of locators`. On the client the API data object also carries a `datalist` array (the resolved option list) so the renderer knows every checkbox to draw, and `entries` (the currently selected locators) so it knows which are checked.

**Value:** `array` of `locators`, or `null`.

**Storage shape.** A component never touches the database; it reads and writes through its section. Like every related component, `component_check_box` does **not** keep an isolated value column — its locators live in the section-wide global `relations` container, and the component slices its own subset out of that bag by matching `from_component_tipo` (its own `tipo`) and `section_tipo`. The canonical locator shape is `{type, section_tipo, section_id, from_component_tipo}`; `type` is the relation type (`dd151` by default), `section_tipo`/`section_id` point at the selected list-of-values record, and `from_component_tipo` names this component.

```json
{
    "relations" : [
        {"type":"dd151","section_id":"1","section_tipo":"rsc723","from_component_tipo":"tch191"},
        {"type":"dd151","section_id":"2","section_tipo":"rsc723","from_component_tipo":"tch191"}
    ]
}
```

When the component is instantiated it gets its data from its section in `lg-nolan` (the relation has no language). On save, each incoming locator is normalized by the shared relation write engine (`src/core/relations/save.ts`): `type` is resolved from the component's relation type (`properties.config_relation.relation_type`, falling back to the descriptor's `defaultRelationType`), `from_component_tipo` is forced to the component's own `tipo`, auto-references and malformed locators are rejected, and duplicates are de-duped by equality on `section_tipo`, `section_id`, `type` and `from_component_tipo`.

!!! note "Datum vs. API data"
    The transmitted unit is a `{context, data}` datum. For this component `data` carries the selected locators as `entries`, the resolved option list as `datalist` (built by `getDatalist()`, `src/core/relations/datalist.ts`), plus `parent_tipo`, `parent_section_id`, `row_section_id` and, in search mode, `q_operator`. `context` carries the description (`tipo`, `model`, `mode`, `lang`, `label`, `properties`, `permissions`, `tools`, `view`, `fields_separator`, `target_sections`) and never the values. The `datalist` resolution is shared with `component_select` / `component_radio_button`; see the *dedalo-datalist-resolution* skill.

## Ontology instantiation

A `component_check_box` is created as an ontology node whose `model` is `component_check_box`. Its `parent` is the section (or grouper) it belongs to, `section_tipo` wires it into that section, and the standard `lg-*` term + `is_translatable` flags declare its label (translatability is normally `false` for this related component). The target list-of-values section and the option resolution are declared through the `source` / `request_config` (RQO) in `properties`.

Node definition (shape):

```json
{
    "tipo"         : "tch191",
    "model"        : "component_check_box",
    "parent"       : "tch2",
    "section_tipo" : "tch2",
    "lg-eng"       : "Acquisition type",
    "lg-spa"       : "Tipo de adquisición",
    "translatable" : false,
    "properties"   : { }
}
```

Realistic `properties` block — a checkbox group that lists every term of a small list-of-values section `rsc723`, joins multiple selected labels with `" | "`, and is mandatory:

```json
{
    "mandatory"         : true,
    "records_separator" : " | ",
    "fields_separator"  : ", ",
    "source" : {
        "mode" : "list_of_values",
        "request_config" : [{
            "sqo" : {
                "section_tipo" : ["rsc723"]
            },
            "show" : {
                "ddo_map" : [{
                    "tipo"         : "rsc724",
                    "parent"       : "self",
                    "section_tipo" : "self"
                }],
                "fields_separator" : ", "
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

`section_tipo` / `parent` tell the section which slice of the global `relations` bag belongs to this component; on save the locators are written through the section's record save path against the section's relations column (the section is the single writer to the database). The RQO under `source.request_config` is the query the datalist engine runs to build the option list, so the available checkboxes are entirely ontology-driven.

## Properties & options

All properties are optional and live in the ontology node `properties` JSON. Verified names consumed by this component:

### config_relation

- **Values:** object with `relation_type` and (optionally) `relation_type_rel`.
- **Effect:** sets the relation type written into every locator's `type`. Resolved by the shared relation write engine (`src/core/relations/save.ts`) as `properties.config_relation.relation_type`, falling back to the component's descriptor default (`defaultRelationType`). For `component_check_box` the descriptor default is `DEDALO_RELATION_TYPE_LINK` = **`dd151`** (generic link). Override it to record a different semantic of the selection.

  | typology | tipo |
  |---|---|
  | Link (default) | `dd151` |
  | Indexation | `dd96` |
  | Children | `dd48` |
  | Parent | `dd47` |
  | Filter | `dd675` |
  | Ontology | `dd77` |

  ```json
  {
      "config_relation": { "relation_type": "dd96" }
  }
  ```

  `relation_type_rel` (locator `type_rel`) controls directionality (uni/bi/multidirectional) the same way as other related components; for a closed value list it is normally left at the default.

### source / request_config

- **Values:** an object (`source`) carrying a `request_config` (RQO), or a top-level `request_config`. `verify in ontology` for the exact shape per instance.
- **Effect:** declares the **target list-of-values section** and how to resolve each option's label. The shared select-family resolver (`src/core/relations/models/select_family.ts`) runs this RQO through `getDatalist()` (`src/core/relations/datalist.ts`) to produce the option list as `{value:{section_id,section_tipo}, label, section_id}` items. This is the single source of the checkboxes the user sees, so the option set is changed by editing the RQO, not by editing engine code.

### fields_separator

- **Values:** string (default `", "` in the text/mini list views).
- **Effect:** the character used **between the fields of the target record** when a locator is flattened to a label string (grid, list `text`/`mini` views, export, and when shown inside another component). Resolved with precedence: the ddo's own `fields_separator` -> RQO `show.fields_separator` -> `properties.fields_separator`.

  ```json
  { "fields_separator": ", " }
  ```

  Joins the target fields (e.g. surname `rsc86`, name `rsc85`) as `Ramón y Cajal, Santiago`.

### records_separator

- **Values:** string.
- **Effect:** the character used **between locators (records)** when several selected values are flattened to one string for grid display / export. Resolved with the same precedence: the ddo's own `records_separator` -> RQO `show.records_separator` -> `properties.records_separator`.

  ```json
  { "records_separator": " | " }
  ```

  Joins multiple selected records as `Santiago Ramón y Cajal | Gerty Cori`.

### mandatory

- **Values:** `true` | `false` (default `false`).
- **Effect:** informs the user the field requires a value (UI signal). It is not a server-enforced save block.

!!! note "Standard context properties"
    Like every component, `component_check_box` also honours the generic ontology context blocks carried into the datum `context`: `css` (style stamped on `.wrapper_component`), `request_config` (RQO) and `view` (the render view to use). These are not component-specific options. Any other custom key seen in production should be verified in the ontology.

## Render views & modes

The view is read from `context.view` (default `default`) and dispatched per mode by the render files. Verified from the source:

| View | edit | list / tm | search | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `default` | yes | yes | — | edit: one `content_value` per `datalist` option, each a `<label>` wrapping an `<input type=checkbox>`; checked when a matching locator is in `entries`. Read users (permission 1) see only the selected labels as read-only `content_value` nodes. list: joined value string. |
| `line` | yes | — | — | Same content as default but the wrapper has no label (`label:null`), `display:contents` for compact inline layout. |
| `print` | yes | — | — | Reuses the `default` edit view but forces `permissions = 1` (read-only) and tags the wrapper `view_print`. |
| `tools` | yes | — | — | Two-column grid with a **Select all** master checkbox; each row shows a tool icon + label. Used to render the security-tools profiles field (see *Notes*); `always_active` options render disabled. |
| `mini` | — | yes | — | Minimal `wrapper_mini` with the joined value string; used by service autocomplete / datalists. |
| `text` | — | yes | — | Plain `<span>` with the value joined by `fields_separator` (HTML preserved, e.g. search `<mark>`). |

Search mode renders a single `content_data` with a `q_operator` text input plus one checkbox per `datalist` option; toggling a box updates the instance data and publishes `change_search_element` to rebuild the SQO filter (it does not save).

Modes:

- **edit** — read/write. Every change is saved immediately (`change_handler` builds an `insert`/`remove` `changed_data_item` and calls `change_value`) so value keys stay recalculated; the reset button issues a bulk `remove`. Tabbing into a checkbox auto-activates the component.
- **list / tm** — read-only listing (the `tm` Time Machine render reuses the list render). The displayed value is resolved from the option list: each stored locator becomes the label of the option it matches (`getRelationListValue()`, `src/core/relations/datalist.ts`).
- **search** — builds an SQO relation filter; saves are blocked.

DOM (edit / default): `wrapper_component component_check_box <tipo> <mode> view_default` -> `label`, `buttons_container`, `content_data` -> one or more `content_value` -> `label > input[type=checkbox]`.

## Import / export model

**Import.** The default import format is a JSON array of [locators](../locator.md), conformed by the generic import engine (`conformImportData()`, `src/core/tools/import_data.ts`):

```json
[{"type":"dd151","section_id":"2","section_tipo":"rsc723","from_component_tipo":"tch191"}]
```

An empty cell clears the existing relation.

!!! warning "Gap: bare section_id shorthand not ported"
    A plain `section_id` number / number sequence (with the target section disambiguated via a `<component_tipo>_<target_section_tipo>` CSV column-name suffix when several targets are possible) is not handled by the generic import engine today — only the JSON locator array round-trips. Neither `conformImportData()` nor the CSV import driver (`src/core/tools/import_csv.ts`) contains this shorthand or column-name disambiguation logic.

See [importing data](../importing_data.md#related-data).

**Export.** Label resolution over the stored locators — iterating the `ddo_map`, resolving each target record's label columns and joining fields with `fields_separator` and records with `records_separator` — goes through the generic cell resolver `resolveCellValue()` (`src/core/resolve/relation_list.ts`), consumed by `tools/tool_export/server/tool_export.ts`. See [exporting data](../exporting_data.md).

## Notes

- **Sortable.** Most relation-family descriptors declare `sortable: false` to opt their list column out of sort ordering (media, geolocation, info, security_access, `component_relation_index`/`component_relation_children`…). `component_check_box` does not set the flag, so it keeps the engine default (`resolveSortable()`, `src/core/resolve/structure_context.ts`, defaults to `true`) — its list column is sortable and can appear as a sort target (verified in the sample context, `sortable: true`).
- **Security-tools profiles (`dd1067`).** The security-tools profiles field is built as a `component_check_box` and rendered with the `tools` view; a user's granted tools are resolved from this field's stored locators against the profile registry (`src/core/tools/registry.ts`, `PROFILE_TOOLS_COMPONENT = 'dd1067'`, `src/core/tools/ontology_map.ts`) plus tools flagged `always_active`. Whether the datalist option list itself is enriched with per-tool icon/`always_active` metadata for the `tools` view render has not been independently verified in this checkout.
- **Relation write path.** Locator normalization/validation and dedup, the sibling-preserving dataframe removal cascade on item delete (`removeDataframeDataById()`, `src/core/relations/save.ts`), and locator deletion (`deletePortalLocator()`, same module) are all handled by the shared relation write engine, not by per-model code. Grid/export/diffusion label resolution goes through the shared datalist engine (`src/core/relations/datalist.ts`).
- **Observers / observables.** Wiring, when needed, is configured in the ontology `properties` (see the index page *Observers and observables* section), not in component code.
- **Default tools.** Tools are read-only context, assembled from the model + ontology; nothing is hardcoded per model.
- **Permissions.** Resolved via `getPermissions()` (`src/core/security/permissions.ts`; 0 none / 1 read / 2 read+write / 3 admin). Read users (level 1) get read-only labels; selecting/saving requires level >= 2.
- **Related components:** `component_radio_button`, `component_select` (single-choice variants of the same closed list), [component_portal](component_portal.md), [component_dataframe](component_dataframe.md).
