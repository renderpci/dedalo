The PostgreSQL access layer (`src/core/db/`) holds the connection/transaction primitives, the matrix table read/write functions, the single JSONB codec, the ontology and Time Machine table modules and the schema-asset rebuilders. It is the **only** code in the TS work server that opens a PostgreSQL connection or issues SQL.

## Role

`src/core/db/` is the bottom layer of the work-system stack. Everything above it —
[`section`](../sections/section.md), [`section_record`](../sections/section_record.md),
components, search — resolves *what* to read or write; `src/core/db/` is *how* the
bytes actually reach PostgreSQL. There is no object-per-record here: this is plain
infrastructure — a handful of modules exporting functions over Bun's built-in SQL
client.

It sits directly below the section-record write pipeline:

```

!!! note "MariaDB is not here"
    This layer talks **only to PostgreSQL** (Bun's `SQL` Postgres client). The
    publication / diffusion database (MariaDB/MySQL) is owned **exclusively** by
    the diffusion engine (`src/diffusion/`); the work server ships no MariaDB
    connector at all. See the
    [architecture overview](../architecture_overview.md#the-two-systems) for the
    work-vs-diffusion split.

!!! warning "One process, one pool, no global connection state"
    The server is a single long-lived process holding **one shared connection
    pool** (`postgres.ts`), and request identity never touches it. An in-flight
    transaction is pinned to a reserved connection through `AsyncLocalStorage`,
    never through a module-level variable. Store a connection — or a transaction —
    at module level and you have just handed one request's transaction to another.

## Responsibilities

- **Connection handling** — hold the single process-wide `SQL` pool and expose
  the `sql` handle every caller uses (`postgres.ts`).
- **Transactions** — a managed transaction API (`withTransaction`) with
  single-connection semantics via `AsyncLocalStorage` and flatten-nesting (an
  inner `withTransaction` joins the ambient transaction).
- **Matrix record read** — `readMatrixRecord` returns one row's typed JSONB
  columns both parsed and as raw `::text` twins for parity diffing (`matrix.ts`).
- **Matrix record write** — the typed write verbs over the `matrix*` tables:
  `updateMatrixRecord` (whole-column upsert), `updateMatrixKeysData` /
  `updateMatrixKeyData` (surgical per-key `jsonb_set_lax`), the item-id
  allocators, the counter-driven and explicit-id inserts, and
  `deleteMatrixRecord` (`matrix_write.ts`).
- **JSONB codec** — the single encode/decode chokepoint every write passes through
  (`json_codec.ts`).
- **Ontology I/O** — CRUD, whole-row upsert, filtered search and the backup-table
  protocol over the ontology table `dd_ontology` (`dd_ontology.ts`).
- **Time Machine I/O** — read of `matrix_time_machine` snapshots and the audit
  `recordTimeMachine` write appended by the save pipeline (`time_machine.ts`).
- **Schema maintenance** — (re)apply the declared extensions/functions/
  constraints/indexes and the `REINDEX`/`VACUUM` maintenance sentences
  (`db_assets.ts` over `db_pg_definitions.json`).
- **Injection boundary** — table and column names are identifiers (they cannot
  be bound as parameters) and are validated against fixed allowlists before
  interpolation; every user-facing value is a bound parameter.

## Data model

The physical model is the **matrix** table family described in the
[sections concept page](../sections/index.md#storage-detail-the-data-column-is-split-into-typed-jsonb-columns).
Every matrix row is keyed by the composite `(section_tipo, section_id)` and stores
the record payload across **typed JSONB columns** rather than one blob. The
canonical lists live as `const` allowlists in `matrix.ts`:

| const | contents | purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MATRIX_JSONB_COLUMNS` | `data`, `relation`, `string`, `date`, `iri`, `geo`, `number`, `media`, `misc`, `relation_search`, `meta` | the 11 typed JSONB columns of a matrix row; `readMatrixRecord` projects each column plus its `::text` twin, and every write validates its column against this set. |
| `MATRIX_TABLE_ALLOWLIST` | the allow-list of `matrix*` table names (`matrix`, `matrix_hierarchy`, `matrix_users`, `matrix_dataframe`, `matrix_activity`, …) | every read/write validates its `tableName` against this list via `assertMatrixTable()` — a table not in it is refused. This is the SQL-injection guard for table names. |

Each component model maps to exactly **one** of these columns. The mapping lives
on the per-model DESCRIPTOR (`src/core/components/component_X/descriptor.ts`,
field `column`; e.g. `component_input_text → string`, `component_portal →
relation`) and is read through `getColumnNameByModel()` in
`src/core/ontology/resolver.ts`. The db layer itself does not know about
components — it reads and writes columns and JSON keys; the tipo→column mapping is
done one layer up.

!!! note "`section_id` is allocated by a counter table"
    `insertMatrixRecordWithCounter()` does **not** rely on a serial PK for the
    logical record id. In one statement it takes an advisory lock, computes
    `COALESCE(MAX(section_id),0)+1` as a self-healing fallback, UPSERTs a
    per-section counter into `matrix_counter` (or `matrix_counter_dd` for
    `_dd`/ontology tables), and inserts the row with the returned counter as its
    `section_id`. `insertMatrixRecordWithExplicitId()` is the import/provisioning
    twin that takes a caller-chosen id and raises the counter to
    `GREATEST(value, section_id)` so a later auto-allocation can never reuse it.

There is **no record-object family and no row cache**. Raw record data is fetched
by the plain `readMatrixRecord()` function and resolved by the horizontal engines
(`src/core/resolve/`, `src/core/section/read.ts`) — never by a cached per-row
object. Resolution is request-scoped, so there is nothing to keep alive between
requests and nothing to invalidate.

### How the write pipeline dispatches into this layer

`src/core/section_record/record_write.ts` is the per-record write contract. It
owns the *shape* of a save (which keys, which columns, the delete-key guard) and
delegates the actual SQL to the db-layer functions — a normal component save
resolves to `updateMatrixKeysData(table, section_tipo, section_id, writes)`; a
whole-column replace to `updateMatrixRecord(...)`; a delete to
`deleteMatrixRecord(...)`. The matrix table for a tipo is resolved from the
ontology (`getMatrixTableFromTipo()`), never hardcoded.

### The single JSONB codec

`json_codec.ts` is the one place matrix JSONB values are encoded for a write.
`encodeForJsonb()` walks the value and **rejects** what JSON cannot represent
faithfully (`undefined`, `NaN`/`Infinity`, functions, symbols, dropped object
properties) rather than let `JSON.stringify` silently lose data. An unmodified
column can be passed through untouched as the branded `RawJsonText` — its raw
`::text` read — instead of being re-encoded. That is the lossless path: a column
nobody edited is written back byte-for-byte as it was read.

!!! warning "Bind jsonb as `::text::jsonb`"
    Bun's SQL client JSON-encodes a parameter it infers to be jsonb, which would
    double-encode a pre-encoded JSON string. Every write in this layer therefore
    binds jsonb values as `$n::text::jsonb`: the parameter is sent as text and
    Postgres parses it, keeping `json_codec` — not the driver — in charge of the
    byte-compat semantics.

## Public API

Grouped by concern. Names below are verified against the source; signatures are
abbreviated.

### Connection & transactions (`postgres.ts`)

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sql` | The database handle used everywhere. A `Proxy` over the pool that, on every use, routes to the ambient transaction connection when one is active (see `withTransaction`) and to the pool otherwise. The tagged-template form ``sql`SELECT … ${value}` `` always binds values as parameters; `sql.unsafe(text, params)` is the positional-parameter form used when the query text is built from allowlisted identifiers. |
| `withTransaction(work)` | Run `work` inside a single `BEGIN … COMMIT/ROLLBACK` on one reserved connection; every query issued through `sql` while `work` runs is pinned to it, so in-transaction reads see in-transaction writes. A throw rolls back. Nesting **joins** the ambient transaction — no nested `BEGIN`, no savepoint. |
| `isInTransaction()` | `true` when the current async context is inside a `withTransaction` block. |
| `acquireNodeLock(sectionTipo, sectionId)` | `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('<tipo>_<id>'))` — a per-record transaction lock. Throws if called outside a transaction, where the lock would release immediately. |
| `closeDatabasePool()` | End the pool (tests and graceful shutdown). |

!!! note "Transactions flatten, they do not nest with savepoints"
    An inner `withTransaction` **joins** the outer one: the outer commit or
    rollback is authoritative. This is what stops composed mutation helpers — each
    defensively wrapping its own writes — from fragmenting one logical operation
    into several independent transactions.

### Matrix read (`matrix.ts`)

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `readMatrixRecord(tableName, sectionTipo, sectionId)` | `SELECT id, section_id, section_tipo, <each JSONB column + its ::text twin> … WHERE section_tipo=$1 AND section_id=$2 LIMIT 1`. Returns a `MatrixRecord` (`columns` parsed, `rawText` byte-exact) or `null`. |
| `assertMatrixTable(tableName)` | Throw unless `tableName` is in `MATRIX_TABLE_ALLOWLIST` (the identifier gate every read/write calls first). |
| `MATRIX_JSONB_COLUMNS` / `MATRIX_TABLE_ALLOWLIST` | The canonical column set and table allowlist (see [Data model](#data-model)). |

### Matrix write (`matrix_write.ts`)

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `updateMatrixRecord(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, values, options?)` | Whole-column upsert: UPDATE the given columns, INSERT the same columns if 0 rows matched. `values` is `{column: value}`; each jsonb value goes through the codec, or passes through as `RawJsonText` with `rawTextPassthrough`. Returns `'updated' | 'inserted'`. |
| `updateMatrixKeysData(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, writes)` | Surgical per-key update — one UPDATE covering every `{column, key, value}` pair. A non-null value upserts via `jsonb_set_lax` over `COALESCE(col,'{}')`; a `null` value **removes** the key with `#-` (a NULL column stays NULL; a column that loses its last key keeps `'{}'`). This is the call a component save resolves to. |
| `updateMatrixKeyData(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, column, key, value)` | Single-pair convenience wrapper over `updateMatrixKeysData`. |
| `allocateComponentItemId(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, componentTipo)` | Atomically allocate the next data-item id for a component (increment the per-component counter in the `meta` column via one `UPDATE … RETURNING`; row-level locking serializes concurrent allocations — no explicit advisory lock needed). |
| `absorbComponentItemIds(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, componentTipo, items)` | Raise a component's item-id counter to at least the highest explicit id in `items` (imports, migrations, restored data) so a later allocation can never reuse one. It never lowers the counter. Run it on every write that carries explicit item ids. |
| `insertMatrixRecordWithCounter(table, sectionTipo, jsonbColumns)` | INSERT a new record, allocating `section_id` from the matrix counter under an advisory lock, in one statement. Returns the new `section_id`. |
| `insertMatrixRecordWithExplicitId(table, sectionTipo, sectionId, jsonbColumns)` | INSERT with a caller-chosen `section_id` (import / ontology-provisioning path), raising the counter to `GREATEST(value, section_id)`. Throws if the row already exists. |
| `deleteMatrixRecord(table, sectionTipo, sectionId)` | `DELETE … WHERE section_tipo AND section_id RETURNING id`. Returns the number of rows removed (0 or 1). |

!!! warning "Column names are identifiers, keys are data"
    In `updateMatrixKeysData()` the **column** is interpolated into the SQL `SET`
    clause (PostgreSQL cannot bind a column name), so it is validated against
    `MATRIX_JSONB_COLUMNS`. The JSON **key** (the component tipo) is likewise
    checked against the tipo grammar `/^[a-z]+[0-9]+$/` before it is inlined into
    the jsonb path. Every value is a bound `$n::text::jsonb` parameter — data,
    never SQL. This is the injection boundary of the write path.

### JSON codec (`json_codec.ts`)

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `encodeForJsonb(value)` | Validate — rejecting `undefined`, `NaN`/`Infinity`, functions, symbols, `bigint` and dropped keys — and return compact JSON text (`RawJsonText`) to bind as a `::text::jsonb` parameter. Unicode is left unescaped. |
| `decodeFromJsonb(jsonText)` | Parse jsonb text back into a JS value (thin `JSON.parse` wrapper kept for auditability). |
| `asRawJsonText(jsonText)` | Brand a string as already-encoded JSON so a write passes it through untouched (the lossless path for an unmodified column read via `rawText`). |

### Ontology I/O (`dd_ontology.ts`)

The ontology lives in its own table (`dd_ontology`), keyed by `tipo`.
`dd_ontology.ts` is the ontology counterpart of `matrix_write.ts` and the WRITE
side of the ontology; the cached READ registry every engine resolves against lives
in `src/core/ontology/resolver.ts`.

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `upsertDdOntologyNode(node)` | Whole-row `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(tipo) DO UPDATE` writing every allowlisted column, so a re-parse never leaves stale data behind. Returns the row id. |
| `readDdOntologyRow(tipo)` | Read one raw node's columns by `tipo` (uncached probe for the parser). |
| `updateDdOntologyColumns(tipo, values)` | Partial column update with an INSERT fallback on 0 rows — the sync-order path. |
| `deleteDdOntologyNode(tipo)` | Delete one node. |
| `searchDdOntology(values, order?, limit?)` | Filtered node search (scalar `=` or `{operator, value}` over an operator allowlist); returns matching tipos. |
| `getActiveTlds()` / `deleteTldNodes(tld)` | The installed-TLD set and per-TLD delete (`safeTld`-gated). |
| `createBackupTable(tlds)` / `restoreFromBackupTable(tlds)` / `dropBackupTable()` | The `dd_ontology_bk` backup protocol that is the rollback for a destructive regenerate. |

Every write fans out `clearOntologyDerivedCaches()` — the single invalidation
chokepoint, in `src/core/ontology/cache_invalidation.ts` — so no reader observes a
stale node.

### Time Machine I/O (`time_machine.ts`)

`matrix_time_machine` does **not** follow the standard matrix contract: rows are
flat audit columns, one row per component change. The dd15 virtual section
addresses a row by its own `id` (as `section_id`), while the row's `section_tipo`
column holds the **source** section — never filter TM by `section_tipo='dd15'`.

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `readTimeMachineRow(tmRowId)` | Read one TM row by its primary key (the dd15 `section_id`). |
| `readTimeMachineHistory(sourceSectionTipo, sourceSectionId, componentTipo, limit?)` | Change history of one component on one source record, newest first. |
| `recordTimeMachine(entry, timestamp)` | Append one audit row for a component data change; skipped for excluded sections and non-positive ids. Called by the save/delete pipeline. |
| `TimeMachineWriteHook` / `TimeMachineEntry` | The hook contract the save pipeline honours so Time Machine history cannot be silently dropped. |
| `nowDbTimestamp()` | The Postgres-style timestamp stamped on a Time Machine row. |
| `TIME_MACHINE_SECTION_TIPO` (`'dd15'`) / `TM_EXCLUDED_SECTIONS` | The virtual section tipo and the excluded-section set. |

### Schema assets (`db_assets.ts`)

| symbol | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `createExtensions()` | Run the `CREATE EXTENSION` sentences (pg_trgm/unaccent-backed indexes need them). |
| `rebuildFunctions()` | Drop + recreate the declared SQL functions (`f_unaccent` etc.). |
| `rebuildConstraints()` / `rebuildIndexes(tables?)` | Per-entry, per-declared-table drop + add of constraints / indexes. |
| `execMaintenance()` | Run the `ar_maintenance` sentences (`REINDEX TABLE …` etc.). |
| `recreateDbAssets()` | The full sequence: extensions → constraints → functions → indexes → maintenance. |
| `optimizeTables(tables)` | Per validated table, `REINDEX TABLE CONCURRENTLY` then `VACUUM ANALYZE`. |

`db_pg_definitions.json` declares the extensions, functions, constraints, indexes
and maintenance sentences; `db_assets.ts` consumes it, so every schema extra is
declared in exactly one place.

## How it fits with the rest of Dédalo

- **The write pipeline is the main caller of the matrix functions.** A component
  reads via the section-read engines and writes via
  `section_record/record_write.ts`, which resolve to `readMatrixRecord()` /
  `updateMatrixKeysData()`. Resolution code never issues SQL directly.
- **Search compiles down to `sql`.** The [SQO](../sqo.md) search engine in
  `src/core/search/` builds a prepared statement over the JSONB matrix columns and
  runs it through the shared `sql` handle (Bun's client caches/prepares
  statements itself; there is no hand-rolled prepared-statement registry to
  invalidate).
- **The ontology is itself matrix/`dd_ontology` data.** The active schema (areas,
  sections, components, tools) is stored in `dd_ontology` and read/written through
  `dd_ontology.ts` / `resolver.ts`. See the
  [architecture overview](../architecture_overview.md#the-ontology-is-the-active-schema).
- **Time Machine** snapshots flow through `time_machine.ts`; the save and delete
  pipelines append audit rows via `recordTimeMachine()`.
- **Diffusion is out of scope.** Publication data goes to MariaDB via the Bun
  diffusion engine, not through this layer. See the
  [architecture overview](../architecture_overview.md#the-two-systems).

## Examples

### Run a unit of work in a managed transaction

```ts
// Commits on success; rolls back and rethrows on any throw.
const newId = await withTransaction(async () => {
    const id = await insertMatrixRecordWithCounter('matrix', sectionTipo, values);
    // ... more writes, all pinned to the same connection ...
    return id;
});
```

### Lock a record before mutating it (must be inside a transaction)

```ts
await withTransaction(async () => {
    // serialize concurrent writers on this exact record
    await acquireNodeLock(sectionTipo, sectionId);

    // ... read-modify-write the row safely ...
    await updateMatrixKeysData('matrix', 'oh1', 5, [
        { column: 'string', key: 'oh25', value: ['Hello'] },
    ]);
});
```

### A surgical per-key write (what a component save becomes)

```ts
// set string.oh25 = ['Hello'] and clear meta.oh25 in one UPDATE
await updateMatrixKeysData('matrix', 'oh1', 5, [
    { column: 'string', key: 'oh25', value: ['Hello'] },
    { column: 'meta',   key: 'oh25', value: null }, // null removes the key
]);
```

### Read a record with automatic JSON decoding + a byte-exact twin

```ts
const record = await readMatrixRecord('matrix', 'oh1', 5);
if (record !== null) {
    record.columns.string;   // already parsed (a JS value)
    record.rawText.string;   // the byte-exact ::text of the same column (parity)
}
```

!!! note "Prefer the high-level path"
    The examples above touch the db functions directly to document the surface. In
    application code you almost always go through the section-read engines /
    `section_record/record_write.ts` and the [SQO](../sqo.md) engine — those add
    the metadata, Time Machine, permission and relation handling that the raw
    functions deliberately do not.
