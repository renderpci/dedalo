# The AI Assistant

> See also: [RAG & semantic search](../rag.md) · [Publication API v2 — MCP](../../../diffusion/publication_api/v2/mcp.md) · [Tools catalog](../../../development/tools/reference/index.md) · [Ontology](../../ontology/index.md) · [Glossary](../../glossary.md)

The AI Assistant is a **chat panel inside the Dédalo work application** that lets a cataloguer, researcher or archivist talk to their catalogue in natural language: *"find every interview about the reservoir"*, *"what is in this record?"*, *"create a person named Anna Pujol and link her to this testimony"*. It searches, reads, explains and — when you allow it — proposes edits, always through the **same permissions and the same engine** as the human using it.

This section is written for **two readers**:

- **Operators and administrators** — who install, connect a model, configure and secure the assistant for a real institution. Start at [Installing & enabling](install.md).
- **Integrators and developers** — who want to drive the assistant from their own code or understand its wire protocol. Jump to the [Cookbook](cookbook.md#part-b--for-integrators).

If you read only one paragraph: the assistant is a **thin chat client over a server-side agent**. The model, the tools, the prompt, the audit trail and the privacy controls all live on the Dédalo server. The browser sends a question and renders the streamed answer; it never runs a model and never holds an API key. This is what makes the assistant *safe to point at a real archive* — including archives whose data may never leave the building.

## What it can do

- **Find by meaning, not just by string.** Ask for "displacement caused by a dam" and it can reach the testimony that says "when the water came and we had to leave", using the [semantic-search](../rag.md) layer.
- **Navigate the ontology safely.** It resolves human names to the internal `tipo` identifiers before acting, so it never guesses which section or field you meant.
- **Read and explain records** in your language, citing each record so you can open it.
- **Propose changes for your confirmation** (when write mode is enabled): it never writes on its own — it drafts a *change plan* that you review, op by op, and confirm before anything is saved.
- **See images** (with a vision-capable model): attach an object photograph or a document scan and ask it to describe or transcribe.

## What it is *not*

- It is **not** a second way into your data. It sees exactly what its user could see through the normal client — the same project scope, the same record-level permissions. An assistant answer can never contain a record the person wasn't already allowed to open.
- It is **not** an autonomous editor. In write mode it *proposes*; a human *applies*. The loop that talks to the model is structurally incapable of writing.
- It is **not** the [Publication API's MCP server](../../../diffusion/publication_api/v2/mcp.md). That serves *published* (diffusion) data to the outside world. This assistant works inside the private editing application, on live work data.

## Architecture in one picture

```text
 Browser (thin chat panel)
   │  question + conversation history + current-record context + chosen model
   ▼
 dd_mcp_api : agent_chat_stream           ← the work API, over your normal session + CSRF
   │  server-side system prompt + tool-use loop
   ├──▶ Anthropic  (an external model, e.g. Claude)          egress: external
   ├──▶ a LOCAL endpoint (Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio)         egress: local
   ▼
 TOOL_REGISTRY  (search / read / discovery / write tools)   ← same ACL as the human
   │  every record-content tool passes an EGRESS gate on external models
   │  write mode ▶ a change plan (never executed inside the loop)
   ▼
 you review the plan ▶ dd_mcp_api : agent_apply             ← the confirmed edit
```

The three moving parts:

| Part | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Chat client** | `tools/tool_assistant/` (browser) | Renders the conversation, streams the answer, shows tool activity, presents the change-plan confirm card. Holds no model and no secret. |
| **Agent bridge** | `dd_mcp_api` (`src/core/api/handlers/dd_mcp_api.ts`) | The server actions the client calls: `agent_models`, `agent_chat` / `agent_chat_stream`, `agent_apply`. Runs under the logged-in user's principal. |
| **Agent** | `src/ai/agent/` + `src/ai/mcp/` | The tool-use loop, the model providers, the model catalog, the egress gate, the change-plan harness. |

## How it relates to the other AI surfaces

Dédalo has three distinct AI-facing surfaces. They share the tool layer but serve different jobs:

| Surface | Audience | Data | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI Assistant** (this section) | People inside the work app | Live, private work data | here |
| **`dd_rag_api` — grounded Q&A** | Programmatic callers | Indexed work data, cited answers | [RAG & semantic search](../rag.md) |
| **Publication API v2 MCP** | External MCP clients (Claude Desktop, agents) | *Published* diffusion data | [Publication MCP](../../../diffusion/publication_api/v2/mcp.md) |

There is also a **stand-alone MCP server** (`src/ai/mcp/server.ts`) that exposes the same tool registry to external MCP clients over stdio — useful for connecting Claude Desktop or Claude Code to a Dédalo instance for power users. It is configured separately (the `DEDALO_MCP_*` keys) and is out of scope for this section; see the [configuration reference](configuration.md#the-stand-alone-mcp-server-dedalo_mcp_) for the pointer.

## Is it on? (a 10-second check)

The assistant is **off by default**. It is live when:

1. `DEDALO_AGENT_HTTP_ENABLED=true` is set in `../private/.env`, and
2. at least one model is reachable — either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, or a [`DEDALO_AGENT_MODELS`](connecting_models.md) catalog is configured.

When it is off, every assistant action refuses like an unknown action, and the chat panel shows a "disabled on this server" message instead of an input box. See [Installing & enabling](install.md) for the full first-run walkthrough.

## Reading map

Read top to bottom for a full setup, or jump to what you need:

1. **[Installing & enabling](install.md)** — turn it on, where it appears in the UI, verify it works, common first-run errors.
2. **[Connecting models](connecting_models.md)** — the model catalog: Anthropic (cloud) and local endpoints (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio); per-model privacy class; vision.
3. **[Configuration reference](configuration.md)** — every setting, its default and its effect; write mode; the request limits.
4. **[Privacy & security](privacy_and_security.md)** — the guarantee that matters: how the assistant enforces the same permissions as the human, and how the **egress gate** keeps restricted records from ever reaching an external provider.
5. **[Use cases](use_cases.md)** — what it is good for, with concrete cultural-heritage scenarios.
6. **[Cookbook](cookbook.md)** — recipes: prompt patterns for end users, and HTTP/SSE integration recipes for developers.
