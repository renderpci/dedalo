# Maintenance mode

### Temporarily disable Dédalo access to the user interface

Before a new installation or database upgrade of Dédalo server, it is highly recommended to change the Dédalo state to "maintenance" to prevent data changes, conflicts or user interaction with the new features before it is ready.

Maintenance state close the login to all user including general administrator and it is only possible to enter the working system using the root user.

## Alert to users

When Dédalo switches to maintenance, all user sessions will be deleted and if the system has any registered users, the user will not be able to save their work. To avoid losing your work, you will need to alert all users before switching to maintenance mode.

To alert to users follow this steps:

1. Log in as `root`

2. Go to the maintenance, and locate the `Check config` panel.

3. Set an alert notification for the users.

    Write something like:
    "The system will shut down in a few minutes for maintenance updates. Please save any unsaved work and log out as soon as possible."

4. Click `Activate notification` to set the alert.

??? tip "Option. If you want to do it manually in your server installation"

    1. Locate the config.php file in your Dédalo installation, it is stored in the `/config` directory

        ```shell
        cd /httpdocs/dedalo/config/
        ```

    2. Edit the config.php file, you can use a vim, nano or other text editor.

        ```shell
        nano config.php
        ```

    3. Locate the [`notice_to_active_user`](../config/config.md#notice-to-active-users) at the end of the config file and change the `$notice` variable with the message:

        ```php
        $notice = '<b>Warning</b>. In a few minutes the system will shut down about 5 minutes for maintenance updates. <br>
        Please, save the unsaved work and log out as soon as possible.
        After a few minutes, you can re-login to Dédalo and work again';
        // notice_to_active_users(array('msg'=>$notice, 'mode'=>'warning'));
        ```

    4. Uncomment the call to activate the notification

        ```php
        $notice = '<b>Warning</b>. In a few minutes the system will shut down about 5 minutes for maintenance updates. <br>
        Please, save the unsaved work and log out as soon as possible.
        After a few minutes, you can re-login to Dédalo and work again';
        notice_to_active_users(array('msg'=>$notice, 'mode'=>'warning'));
        ```

        Save the config file and Dédalo will show the notice.

All users will see the message in all Dédalo pages:

![alert to users](assets/20230910_115114_alert_to_user.png)

When the user see this alert the user can save his work and logout. Dédalo will work normally.

You can check what users are active in the Maintenance panel "lock components status" (press the `Refresh` button to show changes)

        ```shell
        cd /httpdocs/dedalo/config/
        ```

    2. Edit the config.php file, you can use a vim, nano or other text editor.

        ```shell
        nano config.php
        ```

    3. Locate the [`DEDALO_MAINTENANCE_MODE`](../config/config.md#defining-maintenance-mode) constant at the end of the config file and chagne it to `true`

        ```php
        define('DEDALO_MAINTENANCE_MODE', true);
        ```

        ??? note "Returning to normal state"
            To revert to normal state set the DEDALO_MAINTENANCE_MODE to `false`.

        Save the config file and Dédalo will enter in maintenance mode.
