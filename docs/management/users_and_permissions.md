# Users, profiles and permissions

## Introduction

Access control in Dédalo answers two separate questions for every request:
*"who are you?"* (**authentication**) and *"what may you do?"*
(**authorization**). The two are handled by two different classes and this guide
ties them together into the everyday administration workflow: how to create a
user, how a profile turns into a per-element permission map, and how those
permissions are computed and enforced on every read and save.

This is a **workflow** page. The exact mechanics live in the reference docs and
are not repeated here at length — read them alongside this guide:

- [security](../core/system/security.md) — the authorization core (resolves and enforces the 0–3 levels).
- [login](../core/system/login.md) — authentication: credentials, session, the users section.
- [component_security_access](../core/components/component_security_access.md) — the stored per-profile permission matrix.
- [API gate](../core/system/api.md) — where the login check, CSRF and permission gates run at the request boundary.

The mechanics below live in `src/core/security/permissions.ts` (the matrix +
`getPermissions`), `src/core/security/auth.ts` (login, Argon2id via
`Bun.password`) and `src/core/security/session_store.ts` (session
issuance/rotation).

!!! note "The Dédalo way: no bespoke tables"
    There is no `users` table and no `permissions` table. Users are ordinary
    records in the **Users** section, profiles are ordinary records in the
    **Profiles** section, and a profile's permission map is an ordinary
    component datum. Everything is versioned in Time Machine, importable and
    propagable like any other data.

## The four permission levels

A permission is a single integer; a higher level always includes the lower ones.

| value | level | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | no access | the element is not returned and may not be read |
| `1` | read only | read, but every write is refused |
| `2` | read / write | read and save |
| `3` | admin | full control (structure edits, debug) |

The absence of a stored row means level `0`. Rows whose value is `0` are **never
persisted** — the editor builds a full tree for the UI but strips every
`value <= 0` on save, so "no access" is simply the absence of a grant.

See [Components — Permissions](../core/components/index.md#permissions) for the
levels from a component's point of view.

## Where users and profiles live

| concept | section | tipo | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User | **Users** | `dd128` (`DEDALO_SECTION_USERS_TIPO`) | login name, password, active flag, profile, projects |
| Profile | **Profiles** | `dd234` (`DEDALO_SECTION_PROFILES_TIPO`) | carries the `component_security_access` matrix (`dd774`) |

A user record links to a profile through its `DEDALO_USER_PROFILE_TIPO`
(`dd1725`) component, and to one or more projects through its
`component_filter_master` (`dd170`). The profile, in turn, owns the **permissions
matrix** (`component_security_access`, tipo `dd774`). When the user logs in, that
matrix is flattened into the fast lookup table that gates the rest of the
session — on the TS server this is `getPermissionsTable()` in
`src/core/security/permissions.ts`, cached per `user_id` in a module `Map`
(see the cache warning below).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["User record<br/>(Users section dd128)"] -->|"DEDALO_USER_PROFILE_TIPO (dd1725)"| P["Profile record<br/>(Profiles section dd234)"]
    P -->|"component_security_access (dd774)"| M["permission matrix<br/>per-element 0–3"]
    U -->|"component_filter_master"| PR["projects<br/>(per-record scope, layer 2)"]
```

The super-user **root** (`section_id = -1`) is outside this model: it is always a
global admin, bypasses the profile/projects checks, and cannot be managed from
the web interface (see [root user](index.md#root-user) and
[changing the root password](changing_root_password.md)).

### Two roles above the profile

Two flags promote a user beyond their profile's grants. They are stored on the
user record and read back from the session for the current user:

- **Global admin** (`DEDALO_SECURITY_ADMINISTRATOR_TIPO`, `dd244`) — bypasses
  the per-record project scope and unlocks the admin-only surfaces (the
  Maintenance area, Time Machine reads, structural operations). It does **not**
  bypass the per-element permission matrix: an admin-flagged user still resolves
  each element through their profile's grants — only the superuser `root`
  resolves level `3` everywhere. Give an admin's profile the grants you expect
  them to have. This is the "general admin" account described
  in the [management index](index.md#general-admin). It is the `isGlobalAdmin`
  flag on the request's `Principal`, resolved by `resolvePrincipal()` in
  `src/core/security/permissions.ts`.
- **Developer** (`DEDALO_USER_DEVELOPER_TIPO`, `dd515`) — grants access to
  development/structure surfaces; the `isDeveloper` flag on the same
  `Principal`.

Both, plus a profile that grants the maintenance area, are required to use the
[Maintenance panel](index.md#maintenance-panel).

## Workflow: create a profile

1. Go to the **Profiles** section (under System administration).
2. Create a new record and name it (e.g. *Cataloguer*, *Read-only reviewer*).
3. Open the **Permissions** component (`component_security_access`). It renders
   the whole ontology as an expandable tree — areas → sections → elements — with
   four radio buttons per node for the levels 0–3.
4. Set the level on each node you want to grant. Areas and sections **derive**
   their level from their children (a parent shows a level only when all its
   children share it), so you normally set leaf elements (components, buttons)
   and let the parents follow. Selecting a value propagates up the parent chain.
5. Save. Only non-zero rows are written; absent rows mean no access.

See [component_security_access](../core/components/component_security_access.md)
for the tree shape, the structural exclusions (the Admin area and its children
are never shown for permissioning), and the per-profile data format.

The `component_security_access` descriptor
(`src/core/components/component_security_access/descriptor.ts`) serves the
dd774 datum for both the editor and read/authorization purposes
(`getPermissionsTable()` in `permissions.ts`, plus the datalist resolver in
`src/core/resolve/security_access_datalist.ts`). The tree editor itself —
steps 3–4 above — lives in `client/dedalo/core/component_security_access/`.

## Workflow: create a user

1. Go to the **Users** section.
2. Create a new record and fill the login name (`dd132`) and password (`dd133`;
   min length 8 — see the gap noted below).
3. Set **Active account** (`dd131`) to *Yes* — an inactive account is refused at
   login.
4. Assign a **profile** (`DEDALO_USER_PROFILE_TIPO`). A user with no profile is
   refused at login (*User without profile*).
5. Assign at least one **project** (`component_filter_master`). A user with no
   project is refused at login (*User without projects*) and, at runtime, sees
   only the records inside their projects (layer-2 scope, below).
6. Optionally promote to global admin and/or developer (above).

!!! warning "Gap: password hashing on save is not implemented"
    The `component_password` descriptor
    (`src/core/components/component_password/descriptor.ts`) is currently a
    plain string column with no save-time hashing hook — the server can only
    **verify** an existing `$argon2id$…` hash at login
    (`src/core/security/auth.ts`); it cannot **create** one through the
    ordinary Users-section save path yet. Until this is implemented, create or
    reset a user's password by setting the hash directly in SQL, the way
    [changing the root password](changing_root_password.md) describes for
    root — the same `matrix_users` row, the same `dd133` component, keyed by
    that user's `section_id`.

!!! note "Who can create whom"
    Per the [management index](index.md), root creates the first general admin;
    general admins can then create other admins, developers and ordinary users
    and assign their profiles/projects — but an account cannot edit its own
    admin/developer configuration.

## How permissions are computed and enforced

All authorization is resolved and enforced **server-side**, never trusting the
client. There are two independent tiers:

1. **Type / schema permission (layer 1).** *"What may this profile do with this
   section or component type?"* — resolved from the flattened permission table.
   A single function reproduces the whole decision order —
   `getPermissions(principal, parentTipo, tipo)` in
   `src/core/security/permissions.ts` — including the Time-Machine admin-only
   clamp, the superuser/tools-register/temp-preset shortcuts, the maintenance
   area block, and the public list/dd/notes read fallback. Resolves to `0` when
   not logged in.
2. **Per-record / project scope (layer 2).** *"Is this specific record inside the
   user's project scope?"* — `getUserProjects(userId)` (same file) resolves the
   user's `dd170` project locators, and `src/core/search/sql_assembler.ts`
   folds them into the generated `WHERE` clause every list/search applies.

The level is resolved in one place but **checked at several chokepoints**: each
dispatch entry point calls `getPermissions`/`getUserProjects` inline at its own
gate.

- **Read** — `src/core/api/dispatch.ts` resolves a read permission (level ≥ 1)
  per action before serving it. Inside the section read
  (`src/core/section/read.ts`), each element the user holds level `0` on is
  dropped from the response entirely (context and data — its value never leaves
  the server), and every served element's context carries its **real** level.
  The client renders from that stamp: `1` draws the component read-only, `≥ 2`
  editable — so a user without a write grant never gets an editable field that
  would only fail at save time.
- **Create / save** — the save paths in `dispatch.ts` and
  `src/core/relations/save.ts` refuse when `getPermissions(...) < 2`.
- **API gates** — tool actions gate inline in `src/core/tools/security.ts`
  (project-scope check) and `dispatch.ts` (section-permission check). A failed
  gate returns the same uniform `{result:false, errors:[...]}` shape from an
  early `return` — there is no separate exception type.

The full enforcement diagram and method list are in
[security](../core/system/security.md#how-permissions-are-enforced).

!!! warning "Invalidate the cache after editing permissions"
    The permission table is cached in a single per-`user_id` module `Map`
    (`permissionsTableCache` in `permissions.ts`) — after editing a profile's
    permissions, the next request must see the new matrix. Call
    `clearPermissionsCache(userId)` (or with no argument, to clear every user)
    after a profile's dd774 data or a user's profile assignment changes; the
    companion `clearUserProjectsCache()` does the same for layer-2 project
    grants. The server is request-scoped via `AsyncLocalStorage` (see
    `engineering/REWRITE_SPEC.md`), so there is no cross-request identity bleed to
    worry about — but these two caches are long-lived across requests by
    design and still need explicit invalidation.

### The no-login allowlist

Authentication is enforced at the [API gate](../core/system/api.md) for every
action **except** a small allowlist of bootstrap and machine-to-machine
actions that must run before a session exists. That list is
`NO_LOGIN_ACTIONS` in `src/core/api/dispatch.ts`: `login`, `get_environment`,
`start`, `get_login_context`, error-report intake from a remote install
(`receive_report`), and the ontology-/code-master reachability and manifest
actions (`get_server_ready_status`, `get_ontology_update_info`,
`get_code_update_info`) — the last three fail closed unless this install is
configured as an ontology or code server (see [Updates](updates/index.md)).

`change_lang` is deliberately **not** in the allowlist, so it requires a
logged-in session; see [Request-scoped langs](../core/system/login.md) for
why. Everything else requires a valid session
(`context.session !== null`); the action name is compared as a strict string
against the allowlist, looked up by exact key in a `Record`.

## Worked example: a read-only profile for one section

Goal: a profile that can **read** the *Archaeological objects* section (say
`rsc197`) and its fields, but cannot edit anything, and has no access to the rest.

1. **Create the profile.** Profiles section → new record → name it
   *Objects reader*.
2. **Open Permissions** (`component_security_access`) and expand the tree to the
   *Archaeological objects* section.
3. **Set the section to level `1` (read only).** Set the section node — and its
   description fields — to `1`. Because parents derive from children, set the
   leaf components to `1` and the section node follows. Leave everything outside
   that section untouched (absent = `0` = no access).
4. *(Optional)* grant `1` on linked **Thesaurus** sections so the reader can see
   the controlled terms referenced by the records, but not edit the vocabulary.
5. **Do not grant the `button_new`** of the section — without write (`2`) on the
   section the create/save path in `src/core/api/dispatch.ts` refuses new
   records anyway, and the thesaurus tree's own button-level check is
   `getPermissionsElement(sectionTipo, 'button_new', principal)` in
   `src/core/ts_object/ts_object.ts`.
6. **Save.** Only the non-zero rows persist, e.g.:

    ```json
    [
        {"id": 1, "tipo": "rsc197", "section_tipo": "rsc197", "value": 1},
        {"id": 2, "tipo": "rsc85",  "section_tipo": "rsc197", "value": 1}
    ]
    ```

7. **Assign the profile** to a user (Users section → user → profile = *Objects
   reader*), with a project so layer-2 scope is satisfied.
8. **Verify.** Log in as that user: the *Archaeological objects* records render
   read-only (the served context stamps level `1`, so the client draws values
   without inputs or tool buttons), any write is refused server-side (`< 2`),
   and other sections and ungranted components do not appear at all (`0` —
   dropped from the response, values included). The user only sees records
   inside their assigned projects.

!!! note "Programmatic grant (dev)"
    To grant a profile read+write over a list of sections *and all their
    children* in code — e.g. when generating hierarchies — call
    `setSectionPermissions()` (`src/core/security/section_permissions.ts`).
    Default level `2`, `0` accepted; it merges into the existing matrix (an
    existing `(tipo, section_tipo)` pair is updated in place, never duplicated)
    and invalidates the permissions table.

    The grant lands on the user's **profile** record (`dd234`), resolved through
    their profile-select (`dd1725`) — never on the user record. A user with no
    profile assigned cannot be granted anything: the call returns `ok:false`
    with an error rather than throwing, and callers decide whether that is
    fatal (hierarchy provisioning treats it as non-fatal).

    This is what makes a freshly provisioned hierarchy visible to the user who
    created it — see [install new hierarchies](install_new_hierarchies.md).
