# Dédalo v7 Documentation

Dédalo is a Free and Open Source Cultural Heritage Management System for archives, censuses, inventories and catalogs — archaeology, ethnology, oral memory, numismatics and more. Unlike a generic CMS, it is built to **produce good data** and publish it.

Its defining trait is an **active ontology**: the data schema, the relations between data, the components and tools, and even much of the program behavior are defined as nodes in a thesaurus-like hierarchy and resolved at execution time. Change the ontology and Dédalo's behavior changes — usually without touching the database or the code.

Dédalo is two connected systems:

- **Work system** — the private editing application (TypeScript/Bun server + JavaScript/HTML/CSS client, the client copied as-is from the prior PHP client) that manages the full catalog. Data is stored as JSONB in a PostgreSQL "matrix" table.
- **Diffusion system** — a separate, public, flat copy of the data published to SQL/RDF/XML targets and served through a public API. Data flows one way only, work → diffusion.

New to the vocabulary (section, component, tipo, locator, sqo, rqo, ddo)? Read the **[Introduction & core hub](core/index.md)** and the **[Glossary](core/glossary.md)** first.

> **This is the new TypeScript version.** The Dédalo server has been rebuilt from PHP to
> TypeScript on the Bun runtime. If you want the *why, what and the new foundation* — written
> for developers and humanities readers alike — start with **[The v7 rewrite: from PHP to
> TypeScript](rewrite.md)**.

## Reading paths by role

Pick the path that matches what you are trying to do. Each is a short, ordered list — read top to bottom.

### 1. New developer — understand the architecture

1. [The v7 rewrite: from PHP to TypeScript](rewrite.md) — why the rewrite, what changes, what stays, and the new foundation
2. [Introduction (core hub)](core/index.md) — what Dédalo is, the nomenclature, the active ontology
2. [Architecture Overview](core/architecture_overview.md) — how it all fits together: two systems, the matrix data model, server build → client render
3. [Data model](core/data_model/index.md) — how a value actually lives: the JSON/JSONB foundation, the typed `matrix` columns and the consolidated v7 value item, with a page per data type
4. [Glossary](core/glossary.md) — the full nomenclature reference
5. [Ontology](core/ontology/index.md) — the active schema that drives everything
6. [Sections](core/sections/index.md) and [Components](core/components/index.md) — the table and field abstractions
7. [Development guide](development/index.md) — ecosystem, code style, commit and testing conventions

### 2. Integrator — consume the APIs

1. [Dédalo API v1 (work system)](api/dedalo_api_v1.md) — the JSON API entry point and request flow
2. [Request Query Object (RQO)](core/rqo.md) — the request structure callers send
3. [Search Query Object (SQO)](core/sqo.md) — the JSON abstraction of SQL queries
4. [DD Object (ddo)](core/dd_object.md) and [Locator](core/locator.md) — the data-pointer primitives
5. [API class reference](api/classes/dd_core_api.md) — per-class actions (core, tools, ts, utils, components, manager)
6. [The diffusion engine](diffusion/native_engine.md#client-compatibility) — the `dd_diffusion_api` publication action set served by the work API, plus [RQO field mapping](api/RQO_FIELD_MAPPING.md)
7. [Publication API](diffusion/publication_api/index.md) — serving published data to websites, integrations and AI agents. Use **[v2](diffusion/publication_api/v2/index.md)** (Bun/TypeScript: resource-oriented REST, bracketed filter DSL, RFC 9457 errors, `ETag`/`Link` caching, batch and MCP) for all new integrations; v1 is legacy
8. [RAG & semantic search](core/ai/rag.md) — the `dd_rag_api` action set (semantic search, grounded `ask`, object-image similarity) and the agent/MCP surface; the **[operational cookbook](core/ai/rag_cookbook.md)** has the request recipes
9. [AI Assistant](core/ai/assistant/index.md) — the in-app chat agent; drive it from your own code via `dd_mcp_api` (`agent_models` / `agent_chat_stream` / `agent_apply`), with the full **[SSE protocol + HTTP recipes](core/ai/assistant/cookbook.md#part-b--for-integrators)**
