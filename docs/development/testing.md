The Dédalo server ships its automated suite under `test/`, run by **`bun test`**
(`bun:test`, Bun's built-in Jest-compatible runner). Two things make this suite
different from an ordinary one, and both are on this page: the parity tier replays a
**frozen fixture store** rather than calling a live reference engine, and the invariants
of the codebase are enforced by **tripwire tests** — the rule is *tripwired or deleted*.

Read the green-suite trap section before you trust a green run.

## The suite at a glance

| Tier | Location | Runner | What it covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit + DB gates | `test/unit/` | `bun test` | The engine's internals against pure logic or the real Postgres: codec round-trips, security fail-closed, locator law, media, import, RAG, tools, the write-path `*_native.test.ts` gates, and the tripwires. |
| Parity | `test/parity/` | `bun test` | `*_differential.test.ts` gates that replay the **frozen fixture store** and diff it against what the engine emits today. |
| Integration | `test/integration/` | `bun test` | Diffusion against the real MariaDB deployment. Skips (loudly, with a logged message) when the diffusion DB credentials or socket are absent. |
| Client harness | `client/dedalo/test/client/` | `bun run test:client` | The vanilla-JS client's Mocha/Chai suites, driven in headless Chrome against a running server. Not a `bun test` file. |

## Running the suite

```bash
bun test                       # everything (minutes)
bun test test/unit             # one directory
bun test test/parity           # replays the frozen store — credless, no oracle
bun test test/unit/save_roundtrip.test.ts
bun test --test-name-pattern "save round-trip"
```

Discovery and timeouts come from `bunfig.toml`:

- `root = "test"` confines discovery to the `test/` tree. This matters: `client/dedalo/`
  contains view files whose names match Bun's default test globs
  (`core/widgets/test/…`), and without the confinement Bun would try to run them.
- `timeout = 30000` — DB-touching gates get a generous budget.
- **Preloads** run before any test module is imported, and they matter because
  `src/config/config.ts` freezes the database connection *and* the media root at
  import: `test/preload/test_database.ts` repoints the suite at its own database,
  `test/preload/test_media.ts` repoints it at its own media root (below),
  `test/preload/session_db.ts` points `DEDALO_SESSION_DB_PATH` at a throwaway sqlite
  store (a test run once wiped the live session store and logged everyone out —
  never bypass this by hardcoding a path), and `test/preload/component_registry.ts`
  registers the ontology↔components lookup that production boot performs as a
  module-load side effect.

The static gates are separate: `bunx tsc --noEmit` (strict, zero-new-errors) and
`bun run lint` (Biome, `biome.jsonc`).

### The suite database, and why it cannot be yours

The suite runs on its own database, built from files vendored in the repository:

```bash
bun run test:db:setup          # drops and rebuilds <app db>_test (or DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE)
```

That script restores the install seed, materializes the generic `test` TLD ontology,
imports the hierarchies and registers the tools — and then **stamps the database**
with a `dedalo_test_marker` row: one row, pinned by database constraints, carrying
the build stamp, the git revision that built it and the sha256 of both the seed and
the `test` TLD ontology. It is the only producer of that row anywhere.

Every writer of test data — the corpus loader, the situation builder, the media kit,
the ontology materializer, the scratch-record helpers — calls `assertTestDatabase()`
first and **refuses to write anything at all** on a database that does not carry the
marker. This is the mechanical half of the rule: a database *name* is a claim someone
made about a database (point `DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE` at a colleague's install and the
name still looks right), while the marker is the database's own declaration that it is
disposable. Dédalo runs in production with irreplaceable data, and the suite must be
runnable at any moment; that guarantee cannot rest on anyone remembering.

A refusal reads:

```
createScratchRecord: REFUSING to write test data into database 'dedalo_v7_mht' —
it carries no 'dedalo_test_marker' row … Build the test database with
'bun run test:db:setup'. Nothing was written.
```

The one bypass is the **installer**: a fresh, real installation has no marker and must
still receive the `test` TLD ontology (definitions, no records), so `db_restore.ts`
calls the materializer with `allowAnyDatabase`. Nothing else may.
The gate over all of this is `test/unit/test_db_marker_tripwire.test.ts`.

### The suite media root, and why it cannot be yours either

The database is not the only thing a test can write to. Media derivatives, staged
uploads, publication markers and the corpus's own image/av/pdf files all land on
disk, and until 2026-08-19 they landed in the **installation's** media tree — beside
the masters an institution cannot re-acquire.

They now land in a tree of the suite's own:

```
<repo>/../private/test_media/<suite database name>/
```

`../private/` is already the home of this checkout's non-served, non-repo state (the
`.env`, the session store, `processes/`), and keying the tree by the suite database
name keeps the two together: `files_info.file_path` rows in that database name files
in that tree, so they are one fixture and are rebuilt by one command.

`bun run test:db:setup` **sweeps and rebuilds** the tree beside the database, and
plants a `.dedalo_test_media` marker file in its root. `bun test` creates and marks it
too, so a fresh clone works without the setup step.

The seam is a single key, `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT`, and it does two things at once
**on purpose**: it replaces the media root (it outranks `MEDIA_PATH`) *and* it arms
the refusal. Neither half is settable without the other, so a run cannot be armed at
the installation's root, nor repointed with the guard asleep. Three places set it —
the `bun test` preload, `test:db:setup`, and `scripts/client_test_server.ts`, which
hands it to the server it spawns for the browser suite.

Armed, every door that resolves a media root demands the marker and refuses without
it, naming itself:

```
requireMediaRoot REFUSED: the media root '/var/…/T/scratch' carries no
'.dedalo_test_media' marker file, so it has not declared itself a disposable test
root — it may be an installation's media tree. NOTHING WAS WRITTEN.
```

That applies to a **scratch root a gate makes for itself**, too — a path is a claim,
and "it is under /tmp" is not a guarantee. A gate that needs one calls
`markMediaRoot()` / `scratchMediaRoot()` / `resetMediaRoot()` from
`test/helpers/media_scratch_root.ts`, which plants the declaration for it.

The gate over all of this is `test/unit/test_media_root_tripwire.test.ts`: it derives
the door inventory from the source, proves each door refuses an unmarked root *and*
that the directory is still empty afterwards, and proves a marked root writes.

## Tier 1 — unit and DB gates (`test/unit/`)

An ordinary `bun:test` file importing the module under test from `../../src/…`. Some
gates are pure; many run against the **real Postgres**, because the engine's contract is
the shape of that schema.

This tier also owns the **write-path contracts**. The parity tier can only replay reads
(see below), so every write contract — create, save, delete, duplicate, the Time Machine
audit rows, dataframe `id_key` stamping, portal writes, hierarchy provisioning — is
pinned by a TS-native gate. There are **17** of them, named `*_native.test.ts`
(`test/unit/observer_native.test.ts`, `test/unit/delete_multi_native.test.ts`,
`test/unit/portal_edit_writes_native.test.ts`, …). Their goldens were derived from the
pinned contract shapes, never from whatever the engine happened to emit — that is the
two-sided drift rule, and it is why they can still fail.

## Tier 2 — parity against the frozen fixture store (`test/parity/`)

A parity gate replays one request against the engine in-process (`dispatchRqo()`,
`src/core/api/dispatch.ts`) and diffs the result against the reference response that the
**retired v6 engine** produced for the identical request, harvested before the 2026-07-11
cutover and frozen in `test/parity/fixtures/oracle_harvest/` — **76 gate files, 449
recorded interactions**, matched by a canonical hash of the request.

This store is the read-path baseline of record — and it is **corpus-bound**: every gate
was harvested against one real install's records (`entity: monedaiberica`). The suite
database is built from vendored files only and holds none of those records, so on it
the tier is red by construction (measured 2026-08-18: 173 pass / 208 fail; 186 reds are
corpus absence). That is not a reason to restore the harvest DB — a gate that passes only
against one install's records tests that install, not the engine. The rule now in force is
that **a test uses the generic `test` TLD and builds the situation it tests**; each
corpus-bound differential is being replaced by a test-TLD twin proving the same contract
and then deleted (`engineering/ORACLE_HARVEST.md`, "Generic-TLD replacement map").

### `ORACLE_MODE`

`oracleMode()` (`test/parity/oracle_fixtures.ts`) reads `process.env.ORACLE_MODE ?? 'fixtures'`.
An unknown value throws — a typo can never silently mean the default.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fixtures` | **The default.** No network, no credentials. Each recorded response is served by request hash; a **miss throws loudly** and never falls through to green. |
| `record` | Historical. Froze a live reference response into the store. |
| `live` | Historical. Called the reference engine over HTTP. |

`record` and `live` remain selectable, but nothing answers them: the reference engine is
decommissioned, so **a re-harvest is impossible by definition**. Any change to a fixture
from here on is a deliberate contract edit and needs its `engineering/wire_contract/`
entry in the same change.

Consequence for you: `bun test test/parity/` needs no credentials, but it is **not green
on the suite database** until the corpus-bound gates are replaced (see above). It still
needs Postgres and the normal `../private/.env` config, because the engine half of every
diff runs for real. New parity gates are written on the generic `test` TLD from day one.

### The green-suite trap

!!! warning "A green suite does NOT mean the assertions ran"
    Every differential is gated **at collection time** on an oracle-presence probe:
    `describe.if(<probe>)(…)` (or `test.if(<probe>)(…)` per case). When no oracle is
    available the body is never collected, so the gate **passes trivially**. Before the
    gating existed, an oracle-less run made about 83% of parity assertions vanish while the
    runner reported PASS with zero skips — pure false confidence.

The probe is a predicate exported by the parity API-client module in `test/parity/`. Under
the default `fixtures` mode it means *"is the harvested store on disk"*; under `live` it
meant *"are credentials configured"*. Copy the guard verbatim from a neighbouring
`*_differential.test.ts` — do not hand-roll one.

Two further rules follow from the same trap:

- **Never write a differential that could pass on an empty or degenerate response.**
  Assert on real emitted structure. A diff of `[]` against `[]` is the trap wearing a
  costume.
- A handful of tests still guard on the stricter *live*-oracle predicate (a value that can
  only be produced by an engine that no longer runs — for example a byte-compare of live
  Postgres sequence counters). Those report explicit **SKIP**. A skip is honest; a silent
  pass is not.

### The canary

`test/parity/oracle_canary.test.ts` is the one parity file that is **deliberately not
gated** — its whole job is to make an oracle-less run impossible to mistake for a verified
one. Never add a guard to it.

Under the default `fixtures` mode it asserts the store is present and non-empty, throws
with harvest guidance if it is not, and logs a `[oracle_canary]` line stating exactly what
the run does and does not verify: how many frozen responses are being served, from how many
harvested gate files, that read-path parity is verified against the **frozen** capture, and
how many fixture-exempt gates were skipped.

The fixture-exempt list (`FIXTURE_EXEMPT_GATES` in `test/parity/oracle_fixtures.ts`) is now
**empty**: the write-path gates that could not be served from a frozen response retired
with the reference engine, and their surviving contracts live in the `*_native.test.ts`
twins. `engineering/ORACLE_HARVEST.md` maps every retired gate to its twin.

`ORACLE_OPTIONAL=1` and `ORACLE_REQUIRED=1` still exist but only bite under an explicit
`ORACLE_MODE=live` run; they are vestigial in the default mode.

### Did my test actually assert anything?

The honest checks, in order of cost:

1. **Read the runner's own counts.** A differential that reports `0 pass, N skip` asserted
   nothing. Bun prints skips explicitly — that is the entire point of gating at collection
   time rather than returning early from the body.
2. **Watch the canary output.** It names the number of frozen responses being served.
3. **Break it on purpose.** Change the expected value, run the file, confirm it goes
   **red**, revert. A gate you have never seen fail is not a gate.
4. **A fixture miss is loud.** If your gate issues a request that was never harvested, the
   lookup throws and names the hash — it does not quietly return nothing.

### Normalization: ledger it, never smooth it over

`test/parity/normalize.ts` starts empty of cleverness. Every field it strips carries a
written justification in the file; anything not listed is compared byte-for-byte. Today it
strips only the per-session `csrf_token`, the transient `dedalo_last_error`, and the
recursive `debug` block.

When the engine **deliberately** differs from the frozen reference shape, the gate
transforms the reference side before diffing — and that transformation must be recorded as
an entry in the wire-contract ledger, `engineering/wire_contract/` (for example the
unified empty-component
value `entries: []`). A normalization key with no ledger row is a regression in disguise.
The reviewer's question is always: *is this divergence deliberate and ledgered, or are you
papering over a diff?*

## The tripwires — the invariant-enforcement backbone

A documented invariant with no test that goes red on violation will rot. The 2026-07
foundation audit proved it from both sides: every invariant guarded only by prose had been
violated in practice; every tripwired boundary held. Hence the codebase's load-bearing
law — **invariants are tripwired or deleted**.

A tripwire is an ordinary test in `test/unit/` that greps the tree or asserts a boundary,
and reddens the moment a stated rule is broken. There are **26**, and they are what make
rules like *"no `process.env.` outside `src/config/`"* or *"no cross-request module state"*
mechanical instead of aspirational. A representative sample:

| Tripwire | Invariant it guards |
|---|---|
| `test/unit/sql_confinement_tripwire.test.ts` | Tiered SQL confinement — raw SQL only where it is allowed to live. |
| `test/unit/config_env_tripwire.test.ts` | No `process.env.` / `Bun.env` / `import.meta.env` outside `src/config/` — a stray read silently bypasses the typed catalog, and the setting "isn't taking effect". |
| `test/unit/module_state_tripwire.test.ts` | No cross-request module state. A module-level mutable `Map`/`Set`/`let` holding request, principal or language state bleeds one request into another under concurrency. |
| `test/unit/ws_a_tripwires.test.ts` | Every jsonb bind goes through the one codec; no inline locator comparisons. |
| `test/unit/import_scc_tripwire.test.ts` | No static value-import cycle of size > 1. |
| `test/unit/descriptor_completeness_tripwire.test.ts` | Component descriptors declare their required facets. |
| `test/unit/client_serving.test.ts` | The client serving contract: assets serve byte-identical to the `client/` tree on disk. |
| `test/unit/css_build_tripwire.test.ts` | The committed CSS still matches the LESS it came from. The compiled CSS *is* the shipped artifact (deploy is a checkout), so a stale `.css` means the browser gets bytes no source produces. See [CSS architecture](../css-architecture.md#building-the-css). |
| `test/unit/ci_workflow_tripwire.test.ts` | The CI wiring itself, including the two rules below. |
| `test/parity/oracle_canary.test.ts` | Oracle absence is loud, never a silent green. |

The **authoritative index is `engineering/TRIPWIRES.md`** — a machine-read contract, not a
status note. Two rules keep it from drifting:

- the `TRIPWIRES` array in `scripts/verify.ts` must equal that index **exactly**;
- `scripts/ci/hermetic.sh` runs a **subset** of the same list — the hosted CI tier may run
  fewer gates, never unknown ones.

Both are asserted by `test/unit/ci_workflow_tripwire.test.ts`, so adding a tripwire means
adding a row to the index *and* a line to `scripts/verify.ts` in the same change; either
alone is a red gate.

When you rely on a tripwire, **prove it honest**: plant a violation, watch that exact
tripwire go red, revert.

## `scripts/verify.ts` — the pre-merge gate

The deterministic "definition of done" for a change. It is *not* the full suite; it is the
fast gate that proves you did not break a tripwired invariant and that your change's
nearest gates still pass.

```bash
bun run scripts/verify.ts               # verify uncommitted work (vs HEAD)
bun run scripts/verify.ts --base master # verify the whole branch
bun run scripts/verify.ts --no-tests    # typecheck + lint only
bun run scripts/verify.ts --changed      # print the changed-file set and exit
```

Four stages, in cost order — typecheck (`bunx tsc --noEmit`), lint (`bunx biome check .`),
**all 26 tripwires**, then **neighbours**: the unit and parity test files that import any
`src/` file you touched, discovered from the git diff. Exit 0 only if every enabled stage
is green.

## `scripts/ci/hermetic.sh` — the DB-less tier

The public repo's CI runs on a bare hosted runner with no `../private/.env`, no Postgres
and no secrets. `scripts/ci/hermetic.sh` is the single source of truth for that tier —
both the GitHub workflow and the GitLab mirror invoke this one script, so the two platforms
cannot drift.

It runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run lint`, and the
**16** tripwires empirically proven to pass with no database (`DB_PORT` points at a
deliberately closed port, so an accidental DB touch fails loudly rather than silently
connecting). The 10 remaining tripwires — the ones needing the live Postgres, the client
tree or the fixture store — run in the self-hosted tier via `scripts/verify.ts`.

The script stubs **every** required-no-default key in `src/config/config.ts`. That list is
pinned by a rule of `ci_workflow_tripwire`, for a reason worth internalising: the first
version stubbed four of the eight required keys and passed on every developer machine —
because `../private/.env` was sitting right there, silently satisfying the other four. It
died on the first real runner. A gate that only passes because of your local environment is
not a gate. See `engineering/CI.md` for the full pipeline map.

## The client harness

```bash
bun run test:client        # scripts/client_test_runner.ts
```

The vanilla-JS client keeps its own in-browser **Mocha + Chai** suites, served at
`/dedalo/test/client/index.html`. `scripts/client_test_runner.ts` drives them headlessly
with Puppeteer: it **starts its own server on the test database**, launches Chrome, opens
the runner page, logs in, clicks **run all**, polls until the button re-enables, scrapes
`window.global_stats` plus the per-group and per-suite DOM stats, stops its server, and
**exits non-zero on any failure *or* any pending suite** (a suite that never completed is
not a pass).

**The server is the run's own, on the test database.** This is a browser writing through a
live server, so the marker every other test-data writer asks
(`src/core/test_data/test_database_marker.ts`) cannot see those writes. The command
therefore does not use anybody else's server: it starts one with the test database, a
scratch unix socket, a scratch session store and a scratch state file, and stops it at the
end. Build the database once with `bun run test:db:setup`; nothing else is needed to run
the suite, and no client test can reach the application's records.

**The target is verified, never assumed.** Before Chrome is launched the runner asks the
server it is about to drive, over `/health`, for the fingerprint of its test-database
marker — an opaque hash, served only in development mode, never the database name. A server
that answers no fingerprint (it is on an application database) or a different one (another
checkout's test database) is refused with an explanation. `--url` still points the run at a
server you started yourself and is checked exactly the same way.

It is deliberately **not** a `bun test` file — it needs a live server and a real browser,
so it stays outside `bunfig.toml` discovery and is invoked explicitly.

Operator facts:

- **Options** (each with an env fallback): `--port` (`TEST_PORT`, default `4390` — the
  run's own listener; it walks upward to the first free port), `--url` (`TEST_URL`, a server
  you started yourself), `--timeout` (`TEST_TIMEOUT`, default `300000` ms), `--headless`
  (`HEADLESS`, default `true` — pass `--headless false` to watch it run), `--user` /
  `--password` (`DEDALO_TEST_USER` / `DEDALO_TEST_PASSWORD`), `--auth`
  (`cookie` default, `form`, `mint`), `--strict` and `--no-reseed`.
- **Credentials.** The test database is disposable, so the run supplies its own: it sets
  the login password on the seed's `root` user (which ships without one) and then performs
  a real, password-verified login. `--user` / `--password` override it; `--auth form` drives
  the client's own login UI; `--auth mint` mints a session without verifying any
  credential and announces itself every run.
- **Chrome** comes from `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` if set, otherwise a system Chrome
  install via Puppeteer's `channel` — the bundled-Chromium download is deliberately not
  required.
- **Reseed.** The suites save random values into the shared `test3` playground records, so
  the runner restores the canonical `test3` fixture from its single verified source
  (`src/core/test_data/`) **before and after** the run. Suppress with `--no-reseed`. The
  reseed is DB-only: a long-lived dev server may still hold stale `test3`-derived caches
  afterwards, so restart it when full cache coherence matters.
- **In CI**, `scripts/ci/client_gate.sh` is now a one-line wrapper around the same command.
  Every stateful surface it used to scope by hand (port, unix socket, session sqlite, engine
  state file, diffusion job and activity tables) is scoped by the runner itself, so an
  interactive dev server on the same machine is untouched whether the suite is started by CI
  or by a developer. Note that `mocha` and `chai` are devDependencies — a runner that
  installed with `--production` cannot serve the harness.

## Scratch-write hygiene

Tests share the corpus Postgres with the running system. A careless write corrupts a real
record.

- **Never assert against a mutable production record.** Clone a **scratch twin**, exercise
  the real path against it, assert, and delete it — at both ends, not just in `afterAll`.
- **The database must carry the marker** (above). Every helper below refuses without it,
  so a suite pointed at an installation writes nothing rather than writing carefully.
- DB writes go **only** to the scratch surfaces. The conventions live in one place,
  `test/helpers/test_data.ts` — do not invent new ones:
    - `test2` — a real ontology section resolving to `matrix_test`; use a reserved high
      `section_id` (900000+), clear of genuine records.
    - synthetic tipos (`testrt1`, `zztws*`, …) for write-kernel gates that must not touch a
      real section's ontology.
    - `test3` — only for gates that need the real playground ontology (children,
      relations). Create scratch records through `createSectionRecord()` and **never** touch
      the canonical ids.
    - `dedalo_ts_test_*` tables — the schema-enforced prefix for any scratch table
      (diffusion queues, writers, migrations).
- Clean up **everything you caused**, not just the row you created: Time Machine snapshots,
  activity rows, and diffusion log rows are all side effects of a write and will pollute the
  next gate.
- Never read or write the live session store. The `bunfig.toml` preload already redirects
  it; do not defeat the redirect.

## Writing a new test

Copy a neighbouring test in the right directory and adapt it — that is the fastest correct
path, and it inherits the guards.

**A pure or DB-backed gate** — the default for anything new:

1. Put it in `test/unit/` as `<thing>.test.ts` and import the module under test from
   `../../src/…`.
2. If it writes, use a scratch surface and clean up in `afterAll`.
3. If it asserts a *write* contract, model it on an existing `*_native.test.ts`: derive the
   golden from the specified contract, never from the engine's current output.

**A new invariant** — a rule you want to state in a header or a doc:

1. Write the tripwire in `test/unit/` first. If a rule cannot be mechanically checked, do
   not write the rule.
2. Add its row to `engineering/TRIPWIRES.md` **and** its line to `scripts/verify.ts` in the
   same change.
3. Plant a violation and confirm it goes red.

**A parity gate.** New read-path coverage cannot be harvested — there is nothing left to
harvest from. A new parity gate can only replay interactions already in the frozen store;
new coverage belongs in `test/unit/`, and any change to a fixture is a deliberate contract
edit with a `engineering/wire_contract/` entry.

Finally, run your file while iterating and the gate before pushing:

```bash
bun test test/unit/my_thing.test.ts
bun run scripts/verify.ts
```

## A test that fails only in the full suite

Almost always one of two things, and almost never a real regression:

- **A leaked module mock.** `mock.module` is process-**global**, and `mock.restore()` does
  **not** revert it — a mock installed in one file stays installed for every file that runs
  after it. The pattern (see `test/unit/record_scope_gates.test.ts`): snapshot the real
  module's exports at import time and re-install them in an `afterEach`.

    ```ts
    import * as record_scope from '../../src/core/security/record_scope.ts';
    const REAL_RECORD_SCOPE = { ...record_scope };
    afterEach(() => {
        mock.module('../../src/core/security/record_scope.ts', () => REAL_RECORD_SCOPE);
    });
    ```

- **A scratch collision** — two gates reaching for the same scratch row, or a gate that did
  not clean up after itself.

Check both before you "fix" the code.
