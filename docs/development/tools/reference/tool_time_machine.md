# tool_time_machine

Audit/history view and reversion of record and component changes over time, reading from the `matrix_time_machine` (dd15) change log.

## What it does / why & when to use it

Dédalo records **every user change** to a record's data as a row in the `matrix_time_machine` table (dd15). `tool_time_machine` is the UI that lets a person browse that history for one element and **restore** an earlier version. The user picks a past entry, sees the "Now" value side-by-side with the historical value, and — with **Apply and save** — overwrites the live data from the snapshot. It works on two scopes:

- a **single component** (e.g. one date, one input text), restoring just that component's data, and
- a whole **section record** (restoring all of the record's components at once, including recovering files that were deleted with it).

It also exposes a third, admin-only operation: reverting a whole **bulk process** — undoing in one action every change a batch tool (e.g. [`tool_propagate_component_data`](tool_propagate_component_data.md)) made across many records under one `bulk_process_id`.

Concrete heritage scenario: a cataloguer notices that the *dating* of a coin issue was changed last week to the wrong century. They open the time machine on that *Date* component, see the change list (when / who / what value), select the entry from before the bad edit — the previous value renders in the preview pane — and press **Apply and save**. The component is restored to the correct dating, and the restore itself is logged as a new activity entry. If instead an admin discovers that a propagate-component-data run mis-set a field across 400 records, they open the tool on any affected record, pick the row carrying that run's `bulk_process_id`, and **Revert the bulk process** — every record touched by that run is rolled back to its pre-run value in one operation.

Use it when: someone needs to see the edit history of a record/component, or roll back a mistaken edit or a mistaken batch run. It is not a diff/merge tool and not a general undo stack — it restores a chosen snapshot wholesale into the live row.

## How it works (server + client)

The change log lives in the dd15 `matrix_time_machine` table, accessed server-side through the TS TM read/write helpers (`src/core/db/time_machine.ts`, `src/core/resolve/read_tm.ts` — see the `dedalo-time-machine` skill). Each TM row carries the element's full data snapshot plus metadata (when `dd559`, who `dd578`, what component `dd577`, section_tipo/section_id, and an optional `bulk_process_id`). A bulk run also writes HIDDEN rows (`tm_role` 1, 3, 4: the BEFORE image of each change, a birth marker per created record, the snapshot of a record a run's dataframe cascade emptied, or a revert's D2 deleted) that only `bulk_revert_process` reads — see [tm_record](../../../core/system/tm_record.md#the-bulk-undo-log).

**Client** (`tools/tool_time_machine/js/`):

- `tool_time_machine.js` is the instance. On `build()` it resolves the calling element as `main_element` (for a section caller it loads the section instance itself) and creates a **`service_time_machine`** instance — the shared service that renders the scrollable history list (`core/services/service_time_machine/`). The service's `ddo_map`/config is derived from `main_element` and runs in `mode:'tm'` so the list reads rows from the TM table rather than live data.
- `render_tool_time_machine.js` lays out the tool in a two-column grid: a **current** ("Now") pane, a **preview** pane, a tool bar (language selector + buttons), and the history list. The language selector, and the language the apply confirm names, follow `history_lang()` (`tool_time_machine.js`): `lg-nolan` when the dd15 context of the one-component history read says `tm_main.lang_sliced: false` (`read_tm.ts` `tmMainLaneLaw` — every relation model, whatever its `translatable` flag), so an unsliced main shows no selector and its confirm says it is replaced in full with its dataframes; otherwise the main element's own lang. The tool bar and side-by-side panes only render for non-section callers.
- When the user clicks a list row's preview/eye icon, the service publishes the `tm_edit_record` event; the tool's handler loads the historical component in `load_mode:'tm'` with the row's `matrix_id` into the preview pane (read-only: permissions forced to 1, tools/interface disabled), stores the `selected_matrix_id`, and reveals **Apply and save**. If the picked row has a `bulk_process_id`, a global admin additionally sees **Revert the bulk process** (others see an "contact an administrator" notice).
- **Apply and save** calls `apply_value(...)`; **Revert the bulk process** calls `bulk_revert_process(...)`. Both go through `data_manager.request` to `dd_tools_api`; on success in a popped-out window the tool closes itself. Before closing after a bulk revert it shows `bulk_revert_summary_message(data)` (`render_tool_time_machine.js`) in an alert: the counts and the revert's own bulk id, a not-exact line when `exact !== 'full'`, and per-code counts of `skipped[]` and `inexact[]`.

- **Columns are a server decision.** The history list is an ordinary dd15 `section` instance and sends no column map: `src/core/section/list_definitions/time_machine_list.ts` derives one column set per surface from the SQO's scope. The tool's two surfaces (a component's history, a record's history) emit the annotation component `rsc329` with `view:'text'`, so the cell shows the annotation's **value**; the inspector's narrower component-history block emits the same tipo with `view:'note'`, the icon that opens the annotation editor in a modal.

**Server** (`tools/tool_time_machine/server/{index,tool_time_machine,bulk_revert}.ts`):

- `apply_value` reads the TM snapshot for `matrix_id`, then branches on the target's model:
  - **section** — overwrites the section's stored data; on success it recovers any deleted section media files, logs a recovery activity, and **deletes** the consumed TM row.
  - **component_** — overwrites the component's stored data. A main with dataframe slots is restored under the [two lanes](../../../core/system/tm_record.md#dataframe-mains-two-lanes), in one transaction: the row's OWN lane is put back — a language row's value merged over the live other languages (`mergeRestoredLangSlice` via `restoredLaneValue`), an `lg-nolan` row's `lg-nolan` items (none for a translatable main: its `lg-nolan` rows restore frames only, `rowRestoresValue`) — and, BEFORE the main write, in every slot of the main the main's OWN frames are replaced by the frame state AS OF the row (`readRowLaneState`, `src/core/tm_record/lane_state.ts`: the row itself when it is a frame state — `lg-nolan`, or a Dédalo v6 row carrying frames — else the newest frame-state row below it — `lg-nolan`, or a Dédalo v6 row carrying frames; attributed by `from_component_tipo`). Frames of another main in a shared slot stay live (the preview shows them live too), and a slot key is removed only when nothing is left. A recorded frame whose item existed in any language at the row OR at the frame-state row its frames came from (`frameRowId`), and that the restored value no longer holds, is not written back (`isStaleItemFrame` over the union of `readOtherLangItemIds(coords, [], row)` and `readOtherLangItemIds(coords, [], frameRowId)` — a frameless v6 language row that dropped the only framed item leaves no orphan); a frame saved before its item comes back. A slot the frame state is silent about was empty then and is emptied (`rowSlotTipos`). A row under a slot tipo is refused (`engine.uncovered_scope`): no supported history has one. The restore's own history follows the lanes (`recordMainHistory`: its lane's row, plus an `lg-nolan` row when the frames changed), and no row is written under a slot tipo. Every model, `component_iri` included, splits by one frame predicate (`splitComposed`), so Dédalo v6 title-only iri items are kept. The preview (`section/read.ts`) shows the same reconstructed state: the row's lane, the other lane as of the row (the view language for an `lg-nolan` row), and the frames as of the row. The history list of a lang-sliced main in language X is `lang IN (X, 'lg-nolan')` (`read_tm.ts` `laneClause` — a frame row filed for an undeclared live slot is listed too); an unsliced main's locator loses its lang (`timelineScope`), so every row of it is listed whatever its tag (a Dédalo v6 save of a relation marked translatable was tagged with the working language and holds the whole value); a non-translatable main that keeps language versions (`savesInRequestLang`: `with_lang_versions`, a non-translatable component_iri) asked in `lg-nolan` is read in the request's data language (`timelineScope`). The preview of such a version row shows the base as of it (the read emits no `transliterate_value`). An unsliced main (every relation model) has ONE lane, `lg-nolan`, whatever its ontology `translatable` flag and whatever the request language (`laneLaw()`, `src/core/relations/main_lanes.ts` — the lane follows `isLangSlicedModel` only): its rows are read, previewed and restored as `lg-nolan` rows (value + frames) whatever their tag, and its restore writes `lg-nolan`.
- `bulk_revert_process` replays the run's **undo log** (WC-2026-09-27-bulk-revert-undo-log):
  1. refuses a run still writing (the in-process live-run registry, `src/core/tools/bulk_run_registry.ts`) and a second concurrent revert of the same run;
  2. mints a **new** bulk-process record (the revert is itself a run, so it is revertible exactly);
  3. loads every row of the run, all roles, and groups them into units — a dataframe main with slots is one unit per record, all its lanes together (its language pairs hold a language's value, its `lg-nolan` pairs the `lg-nolan` value + every slot's frames); any other lang-sliced key one unit per `(section_tipo, section_id, tipo, lang)`; any other key one per `(…, tipo)` — an unsliced key's one lane is `lg-nolan`, whatever tag a row carries;
  4. **exact path** (a unit with BEFORE rows): each unit is all-or-nothing, one transaction, and units are undone NEWEST FIRST; per key it locks the row, counts live == earliest BEFORE as `unchanged` (decided first), then checks the chain (`before[i+1] == after[i]`, else `interleaved_write`) and the conflict (live region == the run's last after-image, else `changed_since_run`), and otherwise restores the earliest BEFORE into the live key (`restoreRegion`: other languages kept; an absent BEFORE removes the key), recording its own pair (the persisted bytes, re-read) under the new bulk id. A dataframe main's unit is planned PER LANE, newest lane first: a language lane's chain over its value; the `lg-nolan` lane's chain over its value and, apart, over its own frames (only frames whose `main_component_tipo` is that main, so a shared slot never couples two mains); a conflict on any refuses the whole unit, and a clean unit writes the main key and every slot key in one write (other mains' frames kept); a frame it puts back must not pair an item of a lane it does not restore that the history knew and that no longer exists (`changed_since_run`); a unit that leaves the frames alone but removes an item from every language refuses (`changed_since_run`) when a live frame pairing that item was added after the run (`assertNoOrphanedFrames`; a frame that stood before the run stays); its scope gate needs write access on the main and every slot it writes; the record's modified stamps (`dd197`/`dd201`) are left alone when the run wrote them itself (a CSV import carrying them) — their own units restore them; restoring `dd199`/`dd200` re-derives their `data`-column twin (`inexact`: `metadata_twin`);
  5. records born in the run are deleted through the delete door, under the revert's own bulk id, only when safe (every unit clean, every key — the run's own included — still at its birth value, the marker's image, so a later translation of a run key keeps the record; no inverse reference, delete permission), else `created_record_kept`; cascade targets (dataframe targets a run's `delete_target` cascade emptied — no policy removes a target row since WC-2026-09-29-dataframe-hard-delete-retired — and born records a revert's D2 deleted, when that revert is reverted) are restored INSIDE the transaction of the unit that re-links them, or whose own record they are (a refused unit leaves the target deleted; a target that cannot come back refuses the unit; a referencing unit's gate authorizes a missing record, otherwise its scope is judged on the restored row; a missing row comes back insert-only, with its birth marker, in one transaction), the locators the cascade stripped from other records coming back as ordinary units (a soft `delete_target` wipe gets its wiped keys written back into the surviving row while nothing was written to it since) and reported in `inexact[]` (`cascade_undelete`), else `cascade_delete_not_reverted`. A row that is there is judged by its generation (an epoch opened at the address after the delete snapshot means another record was born there — every explicit-id create that re-uses an address opens one; `data.created_date` is rewritable and never decides): another record at the address refuses the re-linking unit; the same record with a key written since is left as it is and reported at the record, and the unit still runs — judged against the state the revert PRODUCES, never the bare snapshot: the snapshot with every unit of the revert on that record applied by the units' own writers, per language lane (`producedStateOf`); a covered key whose live value equals that, by its unit's own equality (`ProducedKey.same`, strict for an exact key), is settled (its unit finds it `unchanged`); otherwise a key equal to the snapshot passes, a wiped key is put back, and anything else is a write since (a key of a legacy or unplannable unit is never settled); the same record whose every differing key is already at the produced state (a repeat revert) is a silent no-op. A target that refused one unit is retried, and refuses, in every other unit that re-links it. A bulk create at an explicit id where a deleted record lived opens the address's epoch, so an older run's undo log there is never replayed over the new record;
  6. **legacy path** (a run recorded before the undo log): the old `preBulkState` inference from the rows older than the run's earliest row, every row read as the full state (a slot the pre-run row is silent about is emptied — the frame plan covers the main's live slots (declared or holding its frames) plus every slot the pre-run row or the run's rows name; the conflict check covers every slot the plan writes: per slot, the main's live own frames must equal the run's LAST row, else `changed_since_run`). The legacy keys of a main with dataframes (one per language tag, a v6 dataframe save's `lg-nolan` included) are ONE unit: each key restores its MAIN half from its language's own newest pre-run row, and the unit restores, once (frames are language-blind), the FRAME half from the newest visible row of the main in ANY language older than the run's earliest row of the main in any language (`preRunRow` with that bound — a v6 dataframe save is never a language's own row yet is the newest state of the frames, and another language's run row already carries the run's frames), conflict-checked once against the main's last run row in any language (split per language, one language's unit rewound frames a sibling unit then refused as `changed_since_run`); the frames of live items of a language the run did not touch stay live, and a frame of another language's item deleted since is not written back (`isStaleItemFrame`). An unsliced key takes both halves from one row. A v6 dataframe save under a translatable main is tagged `lg-nolan` and holds the main in every language plus the frames: it is read as the `lg-nolan` lane — its `lg-nolan` items and its frames, the other languages' items ignored — so under a translatable main (no `lg-nolan` value) it is a frames-only image (`isFramesOnlyImage`, the predicate `apply_value` and the preview share) — its pre-run state is the main's newest earlier row in any language, the main is left live (its languages are the run's language keys), and its frames come back except those of items deleted since, the ones the history knew at that row that the live main no longer holds (`isStaleItemFrame`; a frame saved before its item comes back); a run row under a slot tipo is `failed` (v7 beta history, unsupported); a one-row history blanks only a record born in the run, else `no_pre_batch_state`. A unit of a main with dataframe slots needs level 2 on every slot it may write (`slotTipos`, else skipped `out_of_scope`); a frame half that would change a slot outside that set needs the caller's grant on it (`assertSlotGrants`, else refused `out_of_scope`). Every legacy write is listed in `inexact[]`.

  Observers fire post-commit per reverted key, then one activity row per key.

## Actions & options

`apiActions` is declared with a **declarative** gate per action — the framework enforces it before dispatch, before the handler ever runs:

```ts
apiActions: {
	apply_value: { permission: 'tipo', minLevel: 2, handler: toolTimeMachineApplyValue },
	bulk_revert_process: { permission: 'section', minLevel: 2, handler: toolTimeMachineBulkRevert },
},
```

| Action | Permission gate | Reads from `options` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apply_value` | declarative: `tipo` @ level 2 (write) on `(section_tipo, tipo)`. For a section restore `tipo === section_tipo`, so it is equivalent to the section gate. ✅ **Per-record project scope IS enforced**: the declarative `tipo` kind checks the section/tipo write level only, so the handler adds the record check itself — `principalCanAccessRecord(section_tipo, section_id, principal)` (`tool_time_machine.ts`, SEC-024 §9.4), skipped only for `section_id <= 0` which addresses no record. (This row previously claimed the check was absent; it was already present. Corrected 2026-08-14.) | `section_tipo`, `section_id`, `tipo`, `lang`, `matrix_id`, `caller_dataframe` |
| `bulk_revert_process` | declarative: `section` @ level 2 (write). Plus imperative **per-row** re-gate: `getPermissions(section_tipo, tipo) >= 2` for every record in the bulk set; a unit of a main with dataframe slots (exact or legacy) also needs level 2 on every slot it may write (`slotTipos`, else skipped `out_of_scope`), and a legacy frame half that would change a slot outside that set needs the grant on it (`assertSlotGrants`, else the unit is refused `out_of_scope`) (rows the caller cannot write are skipped as a `{ reason: 'out_of_scope' }` entry of `data.skipped` — counted, never located — not aborting the whole run). ✅ Per-record project scope is enforced PER ROW: the loop calls `principalCanAccessRecord(row.section_tipo, row.section_id, principal)` (`bulk_revert.ts`) alongside the write-level re-gate, so an out-of-scope row is skipped rather than reverted. (This row previously claimed the check was absent; corrected 2026-08-14.) | `section_tipo`, `section_id`, `tipo`, `lang`, `bulk_process_id`, `bulk_revert_process_label` |

Key option meanings:

| Option | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `section_tipo` | string (req.) | Target section. Also the gate scope. |
| `section_id` | string/int | Target record; gated against the user's project scope. |
| `tipo` | string (req. for `apply_value`) | The element being restored; its model decides the section-vs-component branch. Missing `section_tipo`/`tipo`/`matrix_id` fails closed (`invalid_request`). |
| `lang` | string | Component language to restore. |
| `matrix_id` | int (req. for `apply_value`) | The chosen `matrix_time_machine` row id (the snapshot to restore). |
| `caller_dataframe` | object | Set when the caller is a dataframe element, so the restore targets the right dataframe slice. |
| `bulk_process_id` | int (req. for `bulk_revert_process`) | The batch run to undo; all rows with this id are reverted. |
| `bulk_revert_process_label` | string | Human label stored on the new revert process record. |

Both actions answer the envelope v2 `{ok, request_id, data}`. `bulk_revert_process` returns `data: {counter, unchanged, bulk_process_id, exact, skipped, inexact}` — `counter` the units written, `unchanged` the KEYS already at their pre-run value (a unit may add to both), `bulk_process_id` the revert's OWN new id, `exact` `'full' | 'partial' | 'none'`, `inexact` typed `{basis, …coords}` entries (`legacy_inference`, `legacy_born_in_run`, `cascade_undelete`, `metadata_twin`), and `skipped` typed entries `{reason, section_tipo?, tipo?, section_id?, lang?}` — `reason` is a closed vocabulary (`out_of_scope`, `changed_since_run`, `interleaved_write`, `created_record_kept`, `cascade_delete_not_reverted`, `no_pre_batch_state`, `no_column`, `no_lang`, `failed`), the coordinates ride an entry only once the key has passed the caller's scope gate (an out-of-scope key skips its whole unit, uncoordinated), and the words (a refusal's detail, an exception's text) go to the server log with the request id, never on the wire. `apply_value` on a section restore also returns `restore_deleted_section_media_files`. Neither action is listed in `backgroundRunnable` — they run inline (the client gives `bulk_revert_process` a 180 s timeout).

There is also a lifecycle hook (never inside `apiActions`):

```ts
isAvailable: (context) => context.callerModel !== 'component_relation_children',
```

`component_relation_children` has no time-machine data, so the tool hides itself there — this is now declared by the module itself rather than resolved via a core fallback (contrast `tool_diffusion`, which still needs one; see [Server contract](../server_contract.md)).

## How it is registered & surfaced

`tools/tool_time_machine/register.json` is a **column-keyed dump** (`string`/`relation`/`misc`/… keyed by component tipo — a seeded matrix-row snapshot, not a hand-authored file); `importTools()` passes it through as-is (see [register.json reference](../register_json.md)). The essentials it carries:

- `dd1326` name = `tool_time_machine`; `dd1327` version (`2.0.4`); `dd1328` minimum Dédalo version (`6.2.5`); `dd1644` developer (Dédalo team).
- `dd799` label = "Time machine" (localized across project languages); `dd612` description = "Access and retrieve versions of change history data".
- `dd1335` properties = `{ "open_as": "window", "windowFeatures": null }` → the tool opens in its own window.
- `dd1372` labels supply the localized UI strings used by the client: `apply_and_save`, `recover_section_alert`, `revert_bulk_process`, `info_revert_bulk_process`, `bulk_revert_confirm_msg` (with a `{0}` process-id placeholder), `bulk_revert_process_label`, `apply_value_confirm_msg`, and the revert summary's `bulk_revert_summary` (`{0}` reverted, `{1}` unchanged, `{2}` new bulk id), `bulk_revert_not_exact`, `bulk_revert_skipped_heading` and `bulk_revert_inexact_heading` (`{0}` count).

Surfacing (in `getElementTools`, `src/core/tools/registry.ts`): the tool attaches to **record elements** — both components and section records — and uses its `isAvailable` hook as the last word, hiding only on `component_relation_children`. This register.json does not carry an explicit `dd1330` affected_models relation; surfacing is element/availability-driven, and the bulk-revert UI is further restricted to global admins client-side via `page_globals.is_global_admin`. There is no rule restricting the time-machine section (dd15) to `tool_export` alone — `registry.ts`'s `NO_TOOLS_MODELS` set only covers `component_section_id`/`component_info`, and no dd15-specific rule exists anywhere in the section/tool-filter path (see [tool_export](tool_export.md)).

## Examples

Restoring a single component's value (client `apply_value`, built by `tool_time_machine.js` and sent through `dd_tools_api`):

```js
const rqo = {
    dd_api : 'dd_tools_api',
    action : 'tool_request',
    source : create_source(self, 'apply_value'), // → tool_time_machine::apply_value
    options : {
        section_tipo : 'rsc167',  // the record's section
        section_id   : 482,       // the record
        tipo         : 'rsc170',  // the component being restored
        lang         : 'lg-eng',
        matrix_id    : 91237      // the chosen matrix_time_machine row
        // caller_dataframe : {...}  // only when the caller is a dataframe element
    }
}
const response = await data_manager.request({ body: rqo, retries: 1, timeout: 60000 })
// response → { ok:true, request_id:'…', data:true }
```

Reverting a whole batch run (admin-only `bulk_revert_process`):

```js
const rqo = {
    dd_api : 'dd_tools_api',
    action : 'tool_request',
    source : create_source(self, 'bulk_revert_process'), // → tool_time_machine::bulk_revert_process
    options : {
        section_tipo              : 'rsc167',
        section_id                : 482,
        tipo                      : 'rsc170',
        lang                      : 'lg-eng',
        bulk_process_id           : 5571,                 // the run to undo
        bulk_revert_process_label : 'Reversed the process with id 5571 > …'
    }
}
const response = await data_manager.request({ body: rqo, retries: 1, timeout: 180000 })
// response → { ok:true, request_id:'…', data:{ counter:12, unchanged:1, bulk_process_id:5602, exact:'partial',
//              skipped:[ { reason:'out_of_scope' }, … ], inexact:[] } }
```

A section restore is the same `apply_value` call with `tipo === section_tipo` (the model resolves to `section`); on success the response additionally carries `restore_deleted_section_media_files`.
