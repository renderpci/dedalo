# tool_media_versions

Manages the on-disk media files behind a media component: inspect per-quality versions, delete a quality or a specific version, (re)build versions from the original, conform AV headers, rotate images, and re-sync the component's stored file metadata with what actually exists on disk.

## What it does / why & when to use it

A Dédalo media component (`component_image`, `component_av`, `component_pdf`, `component_3d`, `component_svg`) does not store a single file — it stores a *set of qualities* (e.g. `original`, `default`, `404`, `audio`, `thumb`, ...) derived from the uploaded master, each as a file on disk, plus a `files_info` block in the record that records which qualities exist. `tool_media_versions` is the panel a cataloguer or media administrator opens to manage that file set directly, without leaving the record.

It surfaces three things in one modal:

1. a **live preview** of the media component itself (read-only),
2. a **sync/regenerate** area that compares the qualities recorded in the database (`files_info_db`) against the qualities actually present on disk (`files_info_disk`) and flags a mismatch, and
3. a **versions grid**: one row per quality, showing the real file (name, size, existence) with per-quality buttons to open, (re)build, rotate, delete, or — for AV — conform headers.

Concrete heritage scenario: an archivist uploads a high-resolution TIFF master for a museum object. The streaming/web qualities (`default`, `404`, `thumb`) are generated automatically on upload, but the archivist notices the web preview is sideways. They open **Media versions** on the image component, **rotate** the affected quality, and the derived files are regenerated rotated. Later, a colleague manually deleted a couple of derived files on the server; the record now shows "Files info data is unsync". The archivist opens the tool, sees the disk/DB mismatch in the **Show data** panel, optionally ticks **Delete normalized files**, and presses **Regenerate** to rebuild the missing qualities and write a correct `files_info` back to the record. For an AV file that won't seek properly in the browser, they use **Conform headers** to rewrite the moov atom / headers of a quality.

Use it when: derived media qualities are missing, broken, rotated, un-seekable, or out of sync with the record. Do not use it to *upload* a new master (that is the upload flow / `tool_upload` / `tool_import_files`) — this tool operates on the files of an already-existing media component.

## How it works (server + client)

**Server** (`tools/tool_media_versions/server/{index,media_versions}.ts`). Every action is declaratively gated `permission: 'record', minLevel: 1` (read, `get_files_info` only) or `minLevel: 2` (write, everything else) — the `'record'` gate kind asserts both the section/component permission level **and** the per-record project-scope check in one declarative spec. Each handler reads `tipo` / `section_tipo` / `section_id` (plus action-specific params) from `options`, validates they are present, resolves the target media component's model, and delegates to the real processing engines the Media rebuild shipped:

| Action | Delegates to |
| --- | --- |
| `get_files_info` | the `files_info` scanner (probes each quality on disk) |
| `delete_quality` | file-ops soft-delete for the quality |
| `build_version` | the processing engine (`buildImageVersion`/`buildPdfCover`/…, pixel-budget resize, never-upscale, CMYK→sRGB) |
| `conform_headers` | AV header/moov-atom rewrite (`component_av`-only, per `register.json`'s `specific_actions`) |
| `rotate` | the rotation engine (`component_image`-only) for the matching quality entry |
| `sync_files` | re-reads data then re-derives the component's stored `files_info` |
| `delete_version` | the thumb-specific delete path for the thumb quality, else the general file-ops delete |

All seven actions return the standard `{ result, msg, errors }` envelope; the write actions merge the engine response into that envelope. `sync_files` re-reads current data **before** regenerating, so the regeneration runs against current data. `rotate` reads the component's `files_info`, matches the requested `quality`, and runs the rotation for each matching entry — gated against real ImageMagick/ffmpeg output on scratch media.

**Client** (`tools/tool_media_versions/js/`). `tool_media_versions.js` is the instance; it extends the standard tool lifecycle (`init` / `build` / `render` / `edit` from `tool_common`). In `build()` it resolves its `main_element` from `tool_config.ddo_map` (the ddo flagged with `role: 'main_element'`), finds that component instance in `ar_instances`, and pre-computes the file sets it needs: `files_info_db` (from the record's `entries[0].files_info`), `files_info_disk` (fetched live via `get_files_info`), and filtered views (`files_info_safe`, `files_info_alternative`, `files_info_original`). `render_tool_media_versions.js` builds the DOM: the read-only main-element preview, the sync/regenerate row, and the versions grid. Each client method (`delete_quality`, `build_version`, `conform_headers`, `rotate`, `sync_files`, `delete_version`) builds an RQO with `dd_api: 'dd_tools_api'`, `action: 'tool_request'`, `source: create_source(self, '<action>')`, and the options above, then calls `data_manager.request()`. The destructive/long actions confirm first (`confirm(get_label.sure)`) and use a long client timeout (`3600 * 1000` ms) with a single retry, because rebuilds can take minutes.

**Specific actions.** The rotate and conform-headers buttons are not shown on every media model. The tool's `properties.specific_actions` (from `register.json`) maps each action to the component models it applies to — `rotate` → `component_image`, `conform_headers` → `component_av` — and `render_tool_media_versions.js` only renders a specific action when `self.main_element.model` is in that action's model list.

## Actions & options

`apiActions` declares every action with `permission: 'record'` — `minLevel: 1` for the one read action, `minLevel: 2` for the six write actions — so the framework asserts both the section/component permission level **and** the per-record project-scope check before any handler runs. There is no `backgroundRunnable`: `build_version` runs its own async work inside the processing engine (the `async` option), not via a background fork.

All actions read the same three required options — `tipo` (the component tipo), `section_tipo`, `section_id` — and refuse with an error envelope if any are missing.

| Action | Gate | Extra required / read options | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_files_info` | `record`, level 1 | — | Probe disk for every quality; returns the `files_info` array (existence, name, path, url, size, time per quality). |
| `delete_quality` | `record`, level 2 | `quality` (req.) | Delete the file of one quality. |
| `build_version` | `record`, level 2 | `quality` (req.), `async` (default `true`) | (Re)build one quality from the original. |
| `conform_headers` | `record`, level 2 | `quality` (req.) | Rebuild a quality rewriting file headers (AV seek/compatibility fix). |
| `rotate` | `record`, level 2 | `quality` (req.), `degrees` (req., e.g. `-90` / `90`) | Rotate the matching quality entries. |
| `sync_files` | `record`, level 2 | `regenerate_options` (object, e.g. `{ delete_normalized_files: bool }`) | Re-read data and regenerate the component so `files_info` matches disk. |
| `delete_version` | `record`, level 2 | `quality` (req.), `extension` (optional) | Delete one specific version: the thumb-specific path for the thumb quality, else the general file-ops delete. |

Response shape for every action: `{ result, msg, errors }`. For `get_files_info`, `result` is the files-info array (or `false` on failure); for the write actions `result` is the boolean / merged result of the delegated engine call.

`delete_quality` vs `delete_version`: `delete_quality` removes a quality regardless of extension; `delete_version` targets one concrete file, handling the thumb specially and accepting an `extension` to disambiguate when a quality has more than one file (e.g. a `.pdf` main file alongside derivatives).

## How it is registered & surfaced

`tools/tool_media_versions/register.json` is a **column-keyed dump** (`string`/`relation`/`misc`/… keyed by component tipo — a seeded matrix-row snapshot, not a hand-authored file); `importTools()` passes it through as-is (see [register.json reference](../register_json.md)). Essentials it carries:

- `dd1326` name = `tool_media_versions`; `dd1327` version = `2.0.4`; `dd1328` minimum Dédalo version = `6.2.6`; `dd1644` developer = "Dédalo team".
- `dd1330` affected_models → the media component models (`component_image`, `component_av`, `component_pdf`, `component_3d`, `component_svg`). The tool therefore attaches to **components**, not to sections or areas.
- `dd1335` properties = `{ "specific_actions": { "rotate": ["component_image"], "conform_headers": ["component_av"] } }`. There is **no** `open_as` property, so the tool opens in the default **modal**.
- `dd1372` labels supply the localized UI strings (`show_data`, `sync_data`, `files_info_is_unsync`, `delete_normalized_files`, `regenerate`) across all project languages.
- `dd1331` show_in_inspector and `dd1332` show_in_component select where the button renders for the matched component.

Surfacing (in `getElementTools`, `src/core/tools/registry.ts`): because `affected_models` lists the media component models, the **Media versions** button appears on those components when they are rendered (subject to the inspector/inline flags). The presence of the tool in a component's context is visible in the component sample fixtures, e.g. `src/core/components/component_image/samples/context.json`, `src/core/components/component_av/samples/context.json` — each lists `{ "model": "tool_media_versions", "name": "tool_media_versions", ... }` in its tools array.

## Examples

Client-side `tool_request` (built by `tool_media_versions.js`, sent through `dd_tools_api`). Probe the real files of an image component:

```js
const rqo = {
    dd_api : 'dd_tools_api',
    action : 'tool_request',
    source : create_source(self, 'get_files_info'), // → tool_media_versions::get_files_info
    options : {
        tipo         : self.main_element.tipo,         // e.g. 'rsc176' (the image component tipo)
        section_tipo : self.main_element.section_tipo,  // e.g. 'rsc167'
        section_id   : self.main_element.section_id      // e.g. 25
    }
}
const response = await data_manager.request({ body: rqo, use_worker: true })
// response.result → [{ quality:'original', file_exist:true, file_name:'rsc167_rsc176_25.tif', file_size: 1234567, ... }, ...]
```

Rotate the `default` quality 90° (write action, long timeout, confirm-gated client-side):

```js
const rqo = {
    dd_api : 'dd_tools_api',
    action : 'tool_request',
    source : create_source(self, 'rotate'), // → tool_media_versions::rotate
    options : {
        tipo         : self.main_element.tipo,
        section_tipo : self.main_element.section_tipo,
        section_id   : self.main_element.section_id,
        quality      : 'default',
        degrees      : 90
    }
}
const response = await data_manager.request({ body: rqo, retries: 1, timeout: 3600 * 1000 })
// response → { result:true, msg:'Success. Request done.', errors:[] }
```

Re-sync after files were removed on disk (rebuild + write correct `files_info`):

```js
const rqo = {
    dd_api : 'dd_tools_api',
    action : 'tool_request',
    source : create_source(self, 'sync_files'), // → tool_media_versions::sync_files
    options : {
        tipo               : self.main_element.tipo,
        section_tipo       : self.main_element.section_tipo,
        section_id         : self.main_element.section_id,
        regenerate_options : { delete_normalized_files: false }
    }
}
const response = await data_manager.request({ body: rqo, retries: 1, timeout: 3600 * 1000 })
// response → { result:true, msg:'Success. Request done' }
```
