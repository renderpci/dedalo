# Documentation style guide

> See also: [Development](index.md) · [Code documentation standard](code_documentation_standard.md) · [Documentation hub](../index.md)

This guide defines how to write the **prose documentation** under `docs/` — the MkDocs site you
are reading now. Its goal is a single, coherent voice across every page: uniform structure,
consistent terminology, accurate examples, and clear, native English.

> Scope: the Markdown files under `docs/` only. For doc-blocks and inline comments inside Dédalo's
> TS/JS **source**, see the separate [code documentation standard](code_documentation_standard.md).
> The `docs/superpowers/` working notes (dated plans and specs) are out of scope — leave them as
> historical record.

## Guiding principles

1. **Accuracy first.** A doc that is wrong is worse than no doc. Never invent a method, property,
   tipo, flag or behavior. If you cannot verify a claim against the code, flag it — do not guess.
2. **Explain the *why*.** State the contract, the edge cases and the consequences of getting it
   wrong, not just the surface mechanics.
3. **One page, one subject.** Each page covers one concept. Link to siblings instead of repeating
   them; a fact should live in exactly one canonical place.
4. **Native, plain English.** Short sentences, present tense, active voice. Dédalo is built by a
   Spanish-speaking team — copy-edit ESL phrasing into clear English, but never change a technical
   claim while doing so.
5. **Show, don't only tell.** Every non-trivial concept earns a concrete example — a JSON shape, a
   code snippet, a tipo, or a small table.
6. **Stable identifiers.** Code identifiers, ontology `tipo`s, class/method names, file paths,
   constants and config keys are reproduced **verbatim**. Never "correct" them.
7. **Document the engine as it is.** This manual describes the *current* engine, and nothing else.
   The v7 server was rebuilt from a previous engine, and that history has exactly two homes: the
   [rewrite narrative](../rewrite.md), and the two v6-upgrade pages — where the old configuration
   files are named because they are the *input* you are converting. Anywhere else, describe what
   the code does today. A design is never justified by comparison to a system the reader has never
   heard of; write the statement, not the contrast. **This is mechanically enforced** by
   `test/unit/docs_current_engine_tripwire.test.ts`, which also fails on a link into the
   gitignored internal-process directory, or any link that escapes `docs/`.
8. **Never document a feature the engine does not have.** If you find a page describing something
   that does not exist in `src/`, delete the section — a manual that promises an absent feature is
   worse than silence. If you cannot tell, say so in your PR rather than writing a `TODO` into the
   page.

## Toolchain

The site is **MkDocs + Material for MkDocs** (`mkdocs.yml`). Build locally with `mkdocs build -v`
or `mkdocs serve`. The enabled Markdown extensions you may rely on:

| Feature | Extension | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admonitions (`!!! note`) | `admonition` | callouts (see below) |
| Collapsible blocks (`???`) | `pymdownx.details` | long, optional detail |
| Mermaid diagrams | `pymdownx.superfences` | flow/ER/sequence diagrams |
| Footnotes (`[^1]`) | `footnotes` | asides and definitions |
| Inline attributes (`{width="20"}`) | `attr_list` | image sizing, ids |
| HTML in Markdown | `md_in_html` | rare, only when Markdown can't express it |
| Code titles & highlight | `pymdownx.highlight` | `` ```js title="wrong!" `` |

There is no `nav:` block — navigation is the curated `index.md` reading paths plus per-directory
`index.md` hubs. When you add a page, link it from the relevant hub and, if cross-cutting, from the
root [`index.md`](../index.md) section index.

## Page structure

Every page follows the same skeleton:

```markdown
# Page title

> See also: [Sibling](sibling.md) · [Parent hub](index.md)   ← optional but recommended

One- or two-sentence summary: what this page is and who needs it.

## First real section
...
```

Rules:

- **Exactly one H1** (`#`), and it is the page subject — match the file/concept name (a component
  reference page is titled `# component_image`, a concept page is `# Search Query Object (SQO)`).
- The optional **`> See also:`** line sits directly under the H1, links separated by ` · `.
- Open with a short **summary paragraph** before the first `##`. No wall of text, no history lesson
  unless the page is *about* history.
- Use `##`/`###`/`####` in order — never skip a level. Don't go deeper than `####`.
- **Sentence case** for all headings (`## Data management`, not `## Data Management`).
- A directory's `index.md` is its **hub**: a summary plus a linked, annotated list of the pages in
  that directory. Keep hub link lists in a stable order (conceptual, then alphabetical).

## Voice and terminology

Write in plain, native English. Common ESL fixes: *"is build on"* → *"is built on"*;
*"Dédalo use"* → *"Dédalo uses"*; *"his data"* (for an object) → *"its data"*; *"do a request"*
→ *"make a request"*.

Use the canonical spelling and casing for Dédalo terms — they are defined once in the
[Glossary](../core/glossary.md), link there rather than re-defining:

| Canonical | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Dédalo | with the accent |
| section, component, area, tool, service, widget | lowercase in prose; `code` font for class names |
| `tipo` | lowercase, code font; plural *tipos* |
| matrix table, value item, datum, subdatum | as written |
| locator | lowercase |
| SQO, RQO, ddo, DDO map | acronyms uppercase in prose (`ddo` lowercase only as the literal key) |
| `lg-eng`, `lg-nolan`, `dd151`, `rsc197` | literal tipos/codes always in code font |
| work system, diffusion system | two words, lowercase |

Refer to the reader as **you**; refer to the system as **Dédalo** or **it**. Avoid "we" except in
the few intentionally narrative origin pages.

## Links and cross-references

- Internal links are **relative** and end in `.md` (`[Sections](../sections/index.md)`), so they
  work both in the repo and in the built site.
- Anchor links use the GitHub/MkDocs slug of the heading
  (`[nomenclature](index.md#definitions-of-dédalos-nomenclature)`).
- Link a term to its canonical page on first use in a page, not on every mention.
- A live ontology node is linked as `https://dedalo.dev/ontology/<tipo>` —
  e.g. [oh1](https://dedalo.dev/ontology/oh1).
- Don't link to source directories as if they were doc pages. Link to the sibling reference page
  when one exists; otherwise name the path in `code` font as plain text.

## Code, JSON and examples

- Always tag the fence language: `json`, `ts`, `js`, `sql`, `shell`, `bash`, `dotenv`, `nginx`, `mermaid`.
- **Examples must be real and correct.** Verify snippets against the code. Copy a real shape from
  the codebase rather than hand-writing one. Watch for typos in example code itself — e.g.
  `{ a : 1 ]` instead of `{ a : 1 }` is a bug to fix.
- Keep JSON examples minimal but complete: enough keys to be meaningful, trimmed of noise. Inline
  `// comments` are acceptable in illustrative JSON blocks (they signal "schematic, not literal").
- For "wrong vs right" pairs, use code titles:

  ````markdown
  ```js title="wrong!"
  import '../directory/file'
  ```
  ```js title="right"
  import '../directory/file.js'
  ```
  ````

- Component reference pages open with a JSON **Overview** block describing the typology flags
  (`could_be_translatable`, `is_literal`, `is_media`, `modes`, `default_tools`, `render_views`,
  `data`/`sample_data`, `value`/`sample_value`). Keep this convention and key order.

## Admonitions

Use Material admonitions for asides; keep the type honest:

```markdown
!!! note "Optional title"
    Context or a clarification.

!!! info "..."     general aside / pointer to a skill or deep doc
!!! warning "..."  data-loss, security or footgun — the reader must not miss it
!!! tip "..."      a shortcut or best practice
```

Use `(!)` inline only inside code comments, not in prose — in prose use a `!!! warning`.

## Diagrams and images

- Prefer **Mermaid** (`flowchart`, `erDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`) over screenshots for anything
  structural — it stays correct and themes with the site.
- Screenshots live under the nearest `assets/` directory; size with `{width="…"}` when needed and
  always give descriptive alt text: `![Dédalo ontology view](assets/…png)`.

## Tables and lists

- Use tables for fixed, enumerable facts (permission levels, config keys, type maps). Keep a header
  row and align the pipes for readability in source.
- Use ordered lists only for genuine sequences (steps, precedence). Otherwise use bullets.
- Each bullet in a hub/link list is `**[Title](path.md)** — one-line description.`

## Glossary entries

The [Glossary](../core/glossary.md) is the single source for term definitions. Each entry follows:

```markdown
### term
*SQL equivalent: closest standard analogue (or "No SQL equivalent.").*

One-paragraph definition.
See: [canonical doc](path.md). Related: [other term](#other-term), [another](#another).
```

Terms are alphabetical; codes (`dd151`) file under their first letter.

## Pre-commit checklist (per page)

- [ ] Exactly one H1; headings nested in order; sentence case.
- [ ] Summary paragraph under the H1; `> See also:` where it helps.
- [ ] English reads natively; no ESL slips; no Spanish left in prose.
- [ ] Every technical claim, identifier, tipo and path preserved verbatim and (where touched)
      verified against the code.
- [ ] Every code/JSON fence has a language tag and is syntactically valid.
- [ ] Internal links are relative, end in `.md`, and resolve.
- [ ] Terminology matches the canonical table above and the Glossary.
- [ ] Anything unverifiable is flagged, not invented.
