# Installation

Dédalo is used to manage cultural properties as archeological, ethnological, documentary heritage, memory and oral history. Dédalo is a client -  server application, before install it, you will need an internet server with a Linux SO, with static ip, and a stable internet connection.

In this installation manual you will see how you can prepare your server before install Dédalo.

## 1. Minimum and recommended server

Dédalo uses a NoSQL architecture, an abstraction model controlled by his ontology that requires intense calculations in real time. The data format is not defined in the database and is calculated in the execution time. Besides, Dédalo creates audiovisual editions in real time when the users and visitors search in the inventory. All of these features make intense use of the processor and RAM.

For the space to store all data and media, it depends on every project. Before buying or renting a server, think about the amount of data of your project and future growth. It's very normal that the projects manage thousands or hundred thousand records and images, pdfs or audiovisual files and millions of data relations and editions. Cultural catalogues managed with Dédalo stored all data around the cultural properties and it requires a large RAID system.

Recommended server:

OS:

- Minimal: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS/ Rocky 8 / RedHat 8
- Recommended:  Ubuntu 24.04 LTS / Rocky 9 / RedHat 9

> Note: if you want, you can use other OS as MacOs or Windows, their could be fine to develop or test it, but we do not recommended these options for production.

Hardware:

- Processor: 8 processors with 3+GHZ
- RAM: minimal 16GB / recommended: 32 GB
- HD for OS: 100GB+ for the system in RAID 10 (SSD)
- HD for data: 1TB+ for the data in RAD 10 (if is possible SSD)

Network:

- Ip stable
- minimal: 500mb/s / recommended: 1gpbs
- domain
- SSL certificated

Backup:

- 2 full copies (2 retention copies)

> Note: We recommend using an external backup system, in another building of the server facilities to preserve data from physical problems such as fire or flood.
> Dédalo creates a backup of the database automatically, it prepares the backup file to be copied to the backup system, but, for the media files you will need to configure your server to copy these files manually.

## 2. Installation options

Instead install you can use our "ready to use" virtual machine with all installed and configured.

### 2.1. Ready-to-use Virtual Machine for V6

Then, you can use our V6 ready-to-use Virtual Machine for development:

[Dedalo V6](./install_help.md#v6-ready-to-use-virtual-machine-for-development)

> Note: we do not recommended use this machine as production system, it could be fine to develop or learn about Dédalo. If you want to use it you will need change all passwords because are public.
