# Apache configuration

Dédalo use Apache as http server you can use any other http server but only Apache is tested.

This guide is a helper not a mandatory guide, you can configure Apache as your project needs, therefore that guide is ONLY a reference.

## Using vhosts instead main / default configuration

Is highly recommended to use vhosts instead the default configuration, because you will need control about the domain to use directory
