# Dédalo JSON API v1

> See also: [RQO field mapping](RQO_FIELD_MAPPING.md) · [The diffusion engine](../diffusion/native_engine.md) · [Class reference](classes/dispatch.md)

This page describes the JSON API entry point, the Request Query Object (RQO) format that callers send, and the API classes and actions the server implements.

The single source of truth for what the API can do is the `ACTION_REGISTRY` map in `src/core/api/dispatch.ts`. It explicitly binds every `(dd_api, action)` pair to a handler; a pair that is not registered simply does not exist, and is refused at the first gate. There is no dynamic method lookup and no autoloader fallback.

## API entry point

- HTTP POST with a JSON body. The Bun server accepts the RQO on two paths (`src/server.ts`, `API_PATHS`):
  - `/api/v1/json` — the direct path.
  - `/dedalo/core/api/v1/json[/]` — the alias the client computes relatively from its page URL (`data_manager` fallback `../api/v1/json/`).
- `Content-Type: application/json`.
- The endpoint is a native Bun route; there is no per-request script file to address.

A minimal call:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dd_api":"dd_core_api","action":"start","options":{"menu":true}}' \
  https://your-host/api/v1/json
```

## How the endpoint handles input

- The endpoint reads the JSON body and validates it against the RQO Zod schema (`src/core/concepts/rqo.ts`).
- Multipart uploads are handled by a dedicated branch of the API path in `src/server.ts`, which routes the form data into the media ingest pipeline rather than into the JSON dispatcher.
- The dispatcher (`dispatchRqo`) runs the request through the gates below before reaching a handler.

## Security gates

Every request passes through the gates in `dispatchRqo`, in this order:

1. **Allowlist** — the `(dd_api, action)` pair must be explicitly registered in `ACTION_REGISTRY`; otherwise the request is refused with *"Undefined or unauthorized method (action)"*.
2. **Authentication** — a session is required unless the action is in `NO_LOGIN_ACTIONS` (`login`, `get_environment`, `start`, `get_login_context`, `change_lang` (the login panel's language selector), plus the machine-to-machine intake and ontology/code master-server actions).
3. **CSRF** — authenticated, non-exempt actions must present a valid CSRF token (constant-time compare). The exemptions are listed in `CSRF_EXEMPT_ACTIONS`. A CSRF failure answers `error.code: 'auth.csrf_failed'` (401) plus the session's current `csrf_token` — the shape the client's transparent retry keys on.
4. **Request-scoped language** — the handler runs inside a language context (`AsyncLocalStorage`, `src/core/resolve/request_lang.ts`) seeded from the session, so a user's language choice takes effect on the next request without a caller passing it explicitly, and one caller's language never bleeds into another's request.
5. **Per-action permission gates** — each handler resolves the caller's `Principal` and checks section/component permission levels before any DB work (read requires level ≥ 1, write ≥ 2).

Authentication is Argon2id (via `Bun.password`) over rotating, server-side sessions (`src/core/security/`). Sessions are carried by an HTTP cookie; the CSRF token rides in the response body.

## Request Query Object (RQO): shape and rules

The API expects a normalized object validated by `rqoSchema` (`src/core/concepts/rqo.ts`). Its core fields are:

- `dd_api` (string) — API class to dispatch to (e.g. `dd_core_api`, `dd_utils_api`). Defaults to `dd_core_api`.
- `action` (string, required) — action to run on that API class (e.g. `start`, `read`, `save`).
- `source` (object) — the request target (`model`, `tipo`, `section_tipo`, `section_id`, `mode`, `lang`, `action`, `view`, plus pass-through keys).
- `api_engine` (string) — resolution engine name (defaults to `dedalo`).
- `sqo`, `show`, `search`, `choose` (objects) — search and display configuration objects (each carries a `ddo_map` and optional `sqo_config`).
- `options` (object) — heterogeneous payloads (file metadata, flags, auxiliary data).
- `data` (object) — payload for write actions (e.g. `changed_data` for `save`).

Minimal example RQO:

```json
{
  "dd_api": "dd_core_api",
  "action": "start",
  "options": { "menu": true }
}
```

Multipart upload example (routed to the media ingest branch, not the JSON dispatcher):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "other_field=value" \
  https://your-host/api/v1/json
```

## API classes and actions (from the action registry)

This index lists every `(dd_api, action)` pair registered in `src/core/api/dispatch.ts`. If an action is not listed here and not in the registry, it is not callable.

### dd_core_api (section/record lifecycle and page context)

Registered actions: `start`, `read`, `save`, `read_raw`, `create`, `duplicate`, `delete`, `count`, `get_element_context`, `get_section_elements_context`, `get_section_terms`, `get_indexation_grid`, `get_activity_metric`, `get_ip_country`, `get_environment`.

The page-globals, plain-vars and label payloads are not separate actions: they are served as one `environment` block by `get_environment` and by `start`.

Example — `start` (get the initial context):

```json
{ "dd_api": "dd_core_api", "action": "start", "options": { "menu": true } }
```

### dd_utils_api (utility and system operations)

Registered actions: `login`, `quit`, `get_login_context`, `get_install_context`, `install`, `request_password_reset`, `confirm_password_reset`, `get_system_info`, `get_dedalo_files`, `change_lang`, `convert_search_object_to_sql_query`, `join_chunked_files_uploaded`, `list_uploaded_files`, `get_job_events`, `get_process_status`, `stop_process`, `update_lock_components_state`, `get_lock_status`, `get_server_ready_status`, `get_ontology_update_info`, `get_code_update_info`.

> Note: file `upload` is not a JSON-dispatched action — multipart uploads are handled by the media ingest branch of the API path in `src/server.ts`. `join_chunked_files_uploaded` is the JSON RQO that reassembles a completed chunked upload.
>
> `get_server_ready_status`, `get_ontology_update_info` and `get_code_update_info` are the master-server surface used by remote installations to probe reachability and fetch an update manifest. They are session-free by design and fail closed unless the host is configured as an ontology or code server.

Example — `login` (JSON body):

```json
{ "dd_api": "dd_utils_api", "action": "login", "options": { "username": "admin", "auth": "secret" } }
```

### dd_tools_api (user tools)

Registered actions: `user_tools`, `tool_request`.

For `tool_request`, the tool name is passed in `source.model` and the tool method in `source.action`; the per-tool action allowlist and dispatch live in `src/core/tools/dispatch.ts`:

```json
{ "dd_api": "dd_tools_api", "action": "tool_request", "source": { "model": "tool_time_machine", "action": "apply_value" }, "options": {} }
```

### dd_ts_api (thesaurus / hierarchical tree)

Registered actions: `get_node_data`, `get_children_data`, `add_child`, `update_parent_data`, `save_order`. These are thin wrappers over `src/core/ts_object/ts_api.ts`, which owns permission gating and every refusal.

```json
{ "dd_api": "dd_ts_api", "action": "get_node_data", "source": { "section_tipo": "es1", "section_id": 13919 }, "options": {} }
```

### dd_area_maintenance_api (maintenance and admin)

Registered actions: `widget_request`, `get_widget_value`, `lock_components_actions`. The maintenance dashboard is a widget framework: each panel is one widget, executed through `widget_request` and loaded through `get_widget_value`. The widget registry and its per-widget action allowlists live in `src/core/area_maintenance/widgets/registry.ts`; the widget modules sit alongside it in `src/core/area_maintenance/widgets/`.

Counter administration is a method of the `counters_status` widget, reached through `widget_request` — not a top-level action.

### dd_diffusion_api (publication)

Registered actions: `diffuse`, `get_process_status`, `list_processes`, `cancel_process`, `get_diffusion_info`, `get_engine_advisory`, `retry_pending_deletions`, `validate`, `rebuild_media_index` — the full publication action set, served natively by the core dispatcher (jobs + spawned runner processes). See [The diffusion engine](../diffusion/native_engine.md#client-compatibility).

### dd_rag_api (semantic retrieval)

Registered actions (from `src/ai/rag/api.ts`): `semantic_search`, `retrieve`, `get_agent_context`, `similar_to`, `ask`, `embed_groups`, `similar_objects`, `search_by_text_image`, `characterize_object`. Results are ACL-gated inside each handler (schema ACL + per-record projects filter). The retrieval actions accept an optional `group` (embed-group facet id); `embed_groups {section_tipo}` returns the section's facet ids — empty alike for a malformed tipo, a denied caller or a not-opted-in section (never an existence oracle).

### Component APIs

- `dd_component_portal_api` — portal component. Registered action: `delete_locator`.
- `dd_component_av_api` — audio/video component. Registered actions: `create_posterframe`, `delete_posterframe`, `get_media_streams`.
- `dd_component_3d_api` — 3D component. Registered actions: `move_file_to_dir`, `delete_posterframe`.
- `dd_component_info` — registered action: `get_widget_data`, the single-widget and async-widget compute channel of the [component_info](../core/components/component_info.md) framework. Read-time (non-async) widgets are computed during the section read instead, by the `component_info` emit hook.

Text-area tags have no API class of their own: tag resolution is served read-time through the section read pipeline (`src/core/section/media_features.ts`), and the transcription tags widget is a `component_info` widget.

### Machine-to-machine classes

- `dd_error_report_api` — registered action: `receive_report`. Anonymous intake of error reports from remote installations; reachable only where the receiver is explicitly enabled, and optionally IP-restricted.
- `dd_mcp_api` — the in-process agent/MCP bridge. Every action fails closed unless the agent HTTP surface is explicitly enabled.

## RQO `source` object (common properties)

Callers typically send these `source` properties (`rqoSourceSchema`):

- `model` / `tipo` / `section_tipo` — ontology model identifiers.
- `section_id` — specific record id, an **integer** (negatives valid; `-1` is the root record). A numeric string still coerces at the boundary, deprecated and counted. External-service remote ids (`001338683`, `Q42`) and synthetic tokens (`search_1`) are not addresses and travel verbatim.
- `mode` — `list`, `edit`, `search`, `tm`, and so on.
- `lang` — language code.
- `action` — a sub-action discriminator used by some methods (e.g. `read` → `get_data`, `resolve_data`, `get_relation_list`).
- `view` — custom view name.

Example `source` snippet:

```json
"source": {
  "model": "section",
  "section_tipo": "numisdata3",
  "mode": "list",
  "section_id": 2
}
```

## Response envelope

Every JSON body is one of exactly two shapes, discriminated by the boolean `ok`:

```json
{ "ok": true,  "request_id": "…", "data": { "context": [ ], "data": [ ] },
  "notices": [ ], "csrf_token": "…" }

{ "ok": false, "request_id": "…",
  "error": { "code": "section.bad_locators", "category": "caller",
             "message": "Invalid or empty locators",
             "label_key": "error_section_bad_locators",
             "retryable": false, "details": { } },
  "csrf_token": "…" }
```

- **`request_id`** is top level on success and on failure. It is the join key to
  the access log line for the same request, which also carries `error_code` and
  `error_category` when the outcome was a failure.
- **`data`** is the payload — for a read, the `{context, data}` unit described in
  [dd_object](../core/dd_object.md). A handler never puts payload anywhere else.
- **`error.code`** is a member of a CLOSED set. Codes are written
  `<domain>.<condition>` (`auth.not_logged`, `perm.denied`,
  `request.invalid_rqo`, `external.timeout`, `internal.unexpected`) and every
  one of them is declared, with its category, status, label and retry semantics,
  in the registry — `src/core/errors/registry.ts`. Branch on the code; never on
  the message.
- **`error.message`** is registry-owned English for logs and command-line use. It
  never interpolates caller data. What a browser renders is **`error.label_key`**,
  a key of the UI label catalogs, so a failure is translated like everything else.
- **`error.details`** carries a small, per-code set of declared scalar values
  (a service name, a rejected path list, a count). Record coordinates and the
  underlying exception are server-side only; `error.debug` appears only when the
  installation is running with API error debugging switched on.
- **`notices`** is the non-fatal channel on a SUCCESSFUL response:
  `{code, label_key, retryable, details?}`. A degraded external source, a
  truncated value or a partial result is reported here — the request succeeded,
  something about the answer is worth saying.
- **Extension keys** may sit at top level beside the envelope keys when the
  client reads them by name (`total`, `job_id`, `pid`, `environment`,
  `source_status`, and the maintenance widgets' `msg` / `errors`, …). They can
  never override an envelope key, and one name is refused outright: `result`
  (the retired mirror of `data`, see below).
- **`csrf_token`** is appended by the dispatcher to every response of a session,
  success and failure alike, for the client's transparent-retry logic.

### The HTTP status is part of the answer

`ok: false` always means a non-2xx status, and the status is derived from the
error code's category:

| category | status | what the caller should do |
|---|---|---|
| `caller` | 400 | fix the request |
| `auth` | 401 | authenticate (or re-authenticate), then retry |
| `permission` | 403 | nothing — retrying changes nothing |
| `not_found` | 404 | the resource does not exist (one shape for every miss) |
| `conflict` | 409 | re-read the state, then decide |
| `limit` | 429 | wait for `Retry-After`, then retry |
| `unavailable` | 503 | a dependency is down; retry later |
| `internal` | 500 | report it — the request was well-formed |

`limit` and `unavailable` failures may carry a `Retry-After` header. Read the
BODY on any status: a non-2xx response is still a well-formed envelope, and it is
where the reason lives.

### There is no other shape

The envelope above is the whole answer. The previous shape's three keys —
`result` (the payload, or `false` on a failure), `msg` and `errors` — were
mirrored beside `ok` / `data` / `error` for one day (2026-08-15) while the last
browser reader of them was rewritten; the mirror was removed on 2026-08-16 and a
body carrying a top-level `result` now fails the envelope schema. Read `ok`,
`data` and `error`; a `msg` or `errors` at top level is a handler's own
extension key (a maintenance widget's report, a tool's per-item detail), never
the error channel.

## Where to look in the code

- API dispatcher + action registry: `src/core/api/dispatch.ts`
- HTTP routing / entry point: `src/server.ts`
- RQO DTO (Zod schema): `src/core/concepts/rqo.ts`
- SQO DTO + boundary sanitizer: `src/core/concepts/sqo.ts` (`sanitizeClientSqo`)
- Auth + sessions: `src/core/security/` (`auth.ts`, `session_store.ts`, `permissions.ts`)
- Response envelope + the one converter: `src/core/errors/` (`registry.ts`, `convert.ts`, `schema.ts`); the handler result type stays in `src/core/api/response.ts`
