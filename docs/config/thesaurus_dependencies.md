# Thesaurus dependencies

Dédalo uses different models for each heritage field. For example, to build a tangible catalogue of an archaeological collection you implement the `tch` (tangible cultural heritage) ontology model (tld); to work with numismatic heritage you implement `numisdata`; to build an interview archive you implement the `oh` tld, and so on.

All of these ontology definitions consume thesauri, so each ontology model depends on certain thesauri.

## Why thesauri do not use the main tld

The short answer: a thesaurus can be shared across disciplines.

The longer answer: if a thesaurus used the same tld as the catalogue model, implementing that tld would also implement the whole model — with every section and field, even the ones you don't want.

For example, the `tch` model uses the `material` thesaurus. It might seem that `material` should carry the `tch` tld so it gets implemented alongside `tch`. But `material` is also used by the numismatic model `numisdata`; if it carried the `tch` tld, implementing the thesaurus would drag in the full `tch` model, which you don't want.

A thesaurus can also be shared between projects and installations, so it needs its own tld.

## Dependencies

The next table show the dependencies between main catalog tld and thesaurus tld.

- √ The thesaurus is used and called directly
- X The thesaurus is not used directly
- \* The thesaurus may or may not be used, depending on the project. The thesaurus is called by the components through their typology.

The above table shows required dependencies for the main tlds, but it is possible to implement more thesaurus than those required, for example, if you want to work with epigraphic legends in amphorae with Greek thesaurus when you are working with the `tch` catalogue, you can implement it.

## How implement?

Thesaurus is a flexible and extensible system. Main definitions with tld and ontology creation is managed and controlled by the `Hierarchies` section [hierarchy1](https://dedalo.dev/ontology/hierarchy1). You can add new registers and create new thesaurus to be used in specific way.

Some thesaurus are common as languages and they are implemented by default in the installation process. Some of them are common but you need to specify if you want implement it or not, as toponymy (official toponymy), some installation will work with Spanish toponymy some with France or Japan or a mix of any of the 147 countries than Dédalo has implemented, this thesaurus can be implemented in the install process or in the [maintenance panel](../management/install_new_hierarchies.md) at any time.
