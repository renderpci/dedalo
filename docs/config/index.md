Dédalo v7 keeps **all** of its configuration in one file, **`../private/.env`** —
one level above the install, outside the web root:

```bash
# ../private/.env
ENTITY=my_museum
DB_NAME=dedalo
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=dedalo
DB_PASSWORD=…
```

Change a value, restart the server, done. There is nothing to edit inside the
served tree — if you are looking for the four config files of v6, see
[what changed in v7](whats_changed_v7.md).

A fresh install needs none of this by hand: the installer writes the file for
you — the command-line installer, the browser wizard or `install.sh`, which all
write the same keys ([what `.env` gets](../install/installer_reference.md#what-privateenv-does-and-does-not-get)).

## The essentials

**The file.** `../private/.env`, mode `0600`, outside the web root. One
`KEY=value` per line. Lists and maps are JSON; booleans are `true`/`false`.

**Precedence.** The process environment beats the file; the file beats the
engine's built-in default.

**It is append-only.** Three edits are legitimate, and nothing else:

- **Add a line** for a key the file does not have yet.
- **Change a value on its existing line**, in place — for example adding a
  domain ontology's code to `ACTIVE_ONTOLOGY_TLDS`, replacing the `[]` of an
  air-gapped install's `ONTOLOGY_SERVERS`/`CODE_SERVERS`, or new database
  credentials. Never add a second line for a key that is already there: the
  file is read top to bottom and the **last** line silently wins.
- **Rename a retired key** when the boot refuses and names it.

Never delete a line: a key you remove silently falls back to a default. For the
keys the installer manages, re-running the installer is the alternative to a
hand edit; it rewrites only those keys and preserves every other line.

**Restart to apply.** Configuration is read once, at boot.

**`install/sample.env`** in the code tree documents every key with its default —
copy the lines you need out of it. The installer leaves a copy at
`../private/sample.env`, but a code update does not refresh that copy, so it lacks
every key added since the install.

## Required settings

A configured install must have `ENTITY`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER` and the
language block (`DEDALO_APPLICATION_LANGS`, `DEDALO_APPLICATION_LANGS_DEFAULT`,
`DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT`, `PROJECTS_DEFAULT_LANGS`), or the server refuses to
boot — loudly, naming the missing key. See
[§5 Required settings](administration.md#5-required-settings).

## Runtime state is not configuration

Maintenance mode, install status and area overrides live in
`../private/ts_state.json`, written by the application itself. Do not hand-edit it.
