/**
 * @method read
 * @summary Consumes and processes data from a $[Readable] stream.
 * @description
 * **Alternative Syntax:**
 * `read(stream, receiver, {closable, readSize})` &#8658; `Promise`
 *
 * Reads the entire stream, using **paused mode**, with support for both synchronous
 * and asynchronous data processing.
 *
 * **NOTE:** Once the method has finished, the onus is on the caller to release the stream
 * according to its protocol.
 *
 * <img src="../../images/read.png" width="641px" height="193px" alt="read">
 *
 * @param {Object} stream
 * $[Readable] stream object.
 *
 * Passing in anything else will throw `Readable stream is required.`
 *
 * @param {Function|generator} receiver
 * Data processing callback (or generator).
 *
 * Passing in anything else will throw `Invalid stream receiver.`
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - `index` = index of the call made to the function
 *  - `data` = array of all data reads from the stream's buffer
 *  - `delay` = number of milliseconds since the last call (`undefined` when `index=0`)
 *
 * The function is called with the same `this` context as the calling method.
 *
 * It can optionally return a promise object, if data processing is asynchronous.
 * And if a promise is returned, the method will not read data from the stream again,
 * until the promise has been resolved.
 *
 * If the function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the method rejects
 * with the same error / rejection reason.
 *
 * @param {Boolean} [closable=false]
 * Instructs the method to resolve on event `close` supported by the stream,
 * as opposed to event `end` that's used by default.
 *
 * @param {Number} [readSize]
 *
 * When the value is greater than 0, it sets the read size from the stream's buffer
 * when the next data is available. By default, the method uses as few reads as possible
 * to get all the data currently available in the buffer.
 *
 * @returns {Promise}
 * When finished successfully, resolves with object `{calls, reads, length, duration}`:
 *  - `calls` = number of calls made into the `receiver`
 *  - `reads` = number of successful reads from the stream
 *  - `length` = total length for all the data reads from the stream
 *  - `duration` = number of milliseconds consumed by the method
 *
 * When it fails, the method rejects with the error/reject specified,
 * which can happen as a result of:
 *  - event `error` emitted by the stream
 *  - receiver throws an error or returns a rejected promise
