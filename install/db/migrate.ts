/**
 * Ordered schema migrations for TS-OWNED tables (audit S2-39, DEC-17 item 7).
 *
 * Scope: ONLY the `dedalo_ts_*` operational tables this server owns (job
 * queue, locks, session mirrors, future additions). The shared matrix/
 * dd_ontology schema is provisioned by the PHP installer during coexistence —
 * a TS-only matrix provisioning path is a documented CUTOVER blocker
 * (engineering/PRODUCTION.md §Schema; DEC-17/DEC-19), not this runner's job.
 *
 * ONE NAMED EXCEPTION — a "seed-defect correction on shared rows" (2026-08-16,
 * first instance 0004_dd560_drop_view_tree.sql). A shipped seed can carry a
 * data mistake that every install inherits; correcting it belongs to the
 * install lane, not to a user edit, so such a file may UPDATE `matrix_*` /
 * `dd_ontology*` rows under FOUR constraints, mechanically gated by
 * test/unit/migration_shared_row_tripwire.test.ts:
 *   1. an UPDATE only — never INSERT / DELETE / TRUNCATE / ALTER / DROP /
 *      CREATE on a shared table (a seed ships through the ontology, a purge is
 *      a tool, a schema change is the installer's);
 *   2. the file carries the tag comment `-- SHARED-ROW SEED CORRECTION:` with
 *      its reason (the gate requires the literal);
 *   3. every such UPDATE pins its WHERE with a jsonb `@>` containment on the
 *      EXACT defective value, so a row an operator has since changed — or
 *      already fixed — is never overwritten (single row / single record);
 *   4. NO TM audit row, by design: this is an install-level correction whose
 *      operator-facing record is the version table itself, not a user write.
 *      The ordinary write law (save_component.ts, tx + TM) is not weakened —
 *      it simply does not apply to a seed correction.
 * Anything outside that shape is not a migration: it goes through
 * db/matrix_write.ts / ontology/ontology_write.ts like every other write.
 *
 * ONE NAMED SCHEMA EXCEPTION — a "shared-schema additive column" (2026-09-27,
 * first instance 0010_tm_role.sql: the time machine's undo-log role). An
 * existing install receives the shared schema ONLY through this lane (the
 * installer restores a seed once, at birth), so a column the engine needs on a
 * shared table has no other road. Such a file may ALTER a shared table under
 * FOUR constraints, gated by the same tripwire:
 *   1. only `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS <name> <type> [NULL]` — no DEFAULT, no NOT
 *      NULL, nothing else: a nullable default-less column is metadata-only (no
 *      rewrite, no scan, no backfill on a 50M-row table) and changes the
 *      meaning of no existing row; or `ADD CONSTRAINT <name> CHECK (…) NOT
 *      VALID` (binds new rows, skips the validation scan). Never DROP / RENAME
 *      / ALTER COLUMN / a validated constraint;
 *   2. the file carries the tag comment `-- SHARED-SCHEMA ADDITIVE COLUMN:`
 *      with its reason;
 *   3. the file bounds its lock wait with `SET LOCAL lock_timeout` (the ALTER's
 *      instant ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock queues behind a long reader, and every
 *      reader queues behind it);
 *   4. the column's meaning is documented in its writer home and ledgered in
 *      engineering/wire_contract/.
 *
 * Model (boring on purpose):
 * - migrations/ holds numbered files `NNNN_name.sql`, applied in filename
 *   order inside one transaction each;
 * - the version table records every applied filename; re-runs skip them
 *   (boot is idempotent);
 * - a failed migration ABORTS the run (later files must not leapfrog a hole)
 *   but the caller (startServer) logs and continues serving — the lazy
 *   CREATE IF NOT EXISTS bootstraps in each subsystem remain the fallback;
 * - a migration's RUN is never bounded (`SET LOCAL statement_timeout = 0`,
 *   whatever the pool's DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS) — see applyMigration;
 * - every migration's lock WAIT is bounded (`SET LOCAL lock_timeout`, default
 *   MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT; a file may set its own), and a file that times out
 *   waiting for a lock (SQLSTATE 55P03) is RETRIED after a backoff before the
 *   run gives up — a boot migration never queues forever behind a long reader,
 *   and never makes every other reader queue behind it.
 *
 * ONLINE CLASS (2026-09-27, install/db/online_migration.ts): a file tagged
 * `-- ONLINE MIGRATION:` is NOT run by the boot runner (it is not a hole —
 * later boot files still apply) but by `runOnlineMigrations`, in the
 * background AFTER the listener binds: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` + `ANALYZE`
 * only, outside any transaction, recorded once every index it names is VALID.
 * A full-heap index build on a shared table belongs there — pre-listen it kept
 * the socket closed past the systemd watchdog (migration_shared_row_tripwire).
 *
 * Evolving a TS-owned table = append a new numbered .sql here. Never edit an
 * applied file (the version table records names, not hashes — editing history
 * silently diverges installs).
