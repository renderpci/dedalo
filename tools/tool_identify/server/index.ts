/**
 * tool_identify server module — ONE action, and a reason for existing.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * tool_identify deliberately had NO server module: `find_matches`,
 * `identify_by_image` and `get_proposals` are single-request reads, and they
 * are already reachable as ordinary API actions on `dd_identify_api`. Adding a
 * tool module to re-expose them would have been a second door onto the same
 * engine with a second set of gates to keep in sync — exactly the coupling the
 * dispatch/handler split exists to avoid.
 *
 * CLUSTERING is the one thing that cannot be served that way. It compares a
 * whole pool of records with each other, two retrieval legs per record, so a run
 * over an import batch is minutes of work, not milliseconds — a request-scoped
 * action would hold a connection open, give the curator no progress and no way
 * to stop it, and die silently on a client navigation. Long-running work belongs
 * on the background-job tier (`core/tools/background.ts`), and the ONLY way onto
 * that tier is a tool action listed in a module's `backgroundRunnable`. So the
 * module exists for the runner, not for the API surface — and it holds exactly
 * the one action that needs it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: CONFIRM A CLUSTER ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Accepting a cluster ("these thirty are all Type X") links every member to a
 * Type record. That link is an ORDINARY `component_portal` value, and there is
 * no server work in writing thirty of them that the normal component save does
 * not already do — TM audit, transaction, counters, diffusion, relation index.
 * `tools/tool_cataloging/js/tool_cataloging.js` is the standing precedent: it
 * performs all of its writes through the standard `change_value` save from the
 * client, and gains a bespoke write path nowhere.
 *
 * So the write half is deliberately NOT here. This module is the READ/cluster
 * half only; confirming a cluster is a client action that issues the same
 * component save the record edit form issues, per member. A bespoke
 * "confirm_cluster" write endpoint would be a second write path into portals —
 * one more place for the save contract to drift, with no capability the existing
 * one lacks.
