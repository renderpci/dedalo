/**
 * tool_import_rdf — the EXECUTOR: applies the operation list the mapping plan
 * (rdf_import_plan.ts) derived from a remote RDF graph and the external
 * ontology, into the caller record and the records it links to.
 *
 * The port of v6 `tool_import_rdf::get_resource_to_dd_object` (search-or-create
 * through `get_resource_match`, `set_data_into_component`, `create_new_resource`),
 * on the engine's own doors, with the v6 write defects fixed rather than ported:
 *
 *   - NEVER OVERWRITES (v6 `set_data_into_component` only filled an empty value,
 *     but its relation branch wrote a bare locator in place of the list). A
 *     literal is written only when its language slice is EMPTY; an IRI is
 *     appended unless that IRI is already stored (any lang); a locator is
 *     appended through the relation INSERT LAW (dedup by address, read grant on
 *     the target, selection cap). Every write is an `appendImport` save
 *     (append_merge.ts), so even a value written concurrently between the
 *     emptiness read and the save is kept beside, never replaced. A single-choice
 *     model (select/radio — its descriptor REFUSES append) is written with a plain
 *     replace only when it holds nothing at all.
 *   - FIND BEFORE CREATE (v6 `get_resource_match` glued the value into a raw SQO
 *     string). A linked resource is found by its identifier through the engine's
 *     own code lookup (`findSectionIdByCode` — the search assembler, a byte-exact
 *     second read, ambiguity refused), scoped to the importing principal. A term
 *     no record holds by its own identifier is looked up by its EQUIVALENTS (the
 *     IRIs its fetched document writes into the match component — skos:exactMatch
 *     on the live mapping; decision 2026-10-02, `matchTerm`): ONE record holding
 *     any is the term (linked, its own identifier appended), several are a
 *     conflict (nothing linked or created). Only an identifier no visible record
 *     carries, directly or through an equivalent, creates one. A resource with NO
 *     identifier is never created: it could never be found again, and every run
 *     would add another copy. An INTERMEDIATE record (v6 `create_new_resource`,
 *     the ddo_map branch — creators → person → URI) is found among the records
 *     the target already links to, by walking the ddo_map path down to the
 *     resource's identifier; v6 answered null for an existing one and so skipped
 *     its children — here it is bound, and its children run.
 *   - EVERY WRITE ASKS THE WRITE DOOR, as the importing principal: an existing
 *     record's component through `authorizeRecordAccess` (section floor, the
 *     dd128-aware pair, the write scope — `assertRecordWriteTarget` — of a record
 *     the run bound at run time); a create through `authorizeSectionTarget` at the
 *     section (and at the match component, so a record is never born without the
 *     identifier that finds it again), the new record's components at the pair. A
 *     refused write is SKIPPED and reported; it never aborts the IRI.
 *   - THE TARGET CHECK FIRST (rdf_import_prune.ts): a link into a section its
 *     component does not target — an ontology node mapping the wrong section —
 *     is skipped with that reason before anything is found, fetched or created.
 *   - ONE TRANSACTION PER IRI, ONE SAVEPOINT PER OP. A partial failure is
 *     partial: an op the engine REFUSES (a caller/permission/conflict error —
 *     `relation.insert_refused`, `perm.denied`, `request.invalid_data`,
 *     `resource.conflict` …) rolls back to its savepoint and is a skip with its
 *     code; every op naming the record it failed to bind is skipped as depending
 *     on it; the rest commits. The groups that must stay atomic are one op: a
 *     find_or_create with its identifier write, an intermediate with the op
 *     that completes its path — and a born record whose identifier write is
 *     SKIPPED rather than thrown is refused all the same (`writeIdentity`,
 *     `tool.rdf_identifier_unwritable`): a record born without what finds it
 *     again would be re-created by every run. A term created by its own op
 *     STAYS when the separate link to it is refused (a selection cap, a term not
 *     selectable, the read grant — off_target never gets that far): it is a
 *     complete authority record, found again by the next run, reverted with the
 *     run's dd800. A FAULT (internal.*, a database error that is no refusal, a
 *     save answered `ok:false`) rolls the whole IRI back and is reported; the
 *     run continues with the next IRI.
 *   - ONE dd800 BULK PROCESS PER RUN (`createBulkProcessRecord`, shared with the
 *     mapped-record executor), minted LAZILY by the first write or create: every
 *     TM row and every birth carries it, so a wrong import is revertable as one
 *     operation; a run that changes nothing (a re-run) mints none.
 *
 * The operation list is DATA the plan builder produces with no database access;
 * this module trusts none of it beyond its shape: tipos go through the write
 * door's grammar, languages through the install's declared set, records through
 * the search and the scope. The op's `model` is re-read from the ontology,
 * never taken from the plan.
