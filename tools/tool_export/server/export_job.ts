/**
 * THE EXPORT JOB — tool_export's server-built export (tool_export at scale).
 *
 * Two background actions and one directory read, all owned by tool_export:
 *
 *   build_export_artifact  runs the ONE export producer (`openExportGrid`,
 *                          src/diffusion/export/grid.ts) and writes every line
 *                          it yields into the job's SPOOL (artifact_store.ts),
 *                          byte-identical to the get_export_grid NDJSON stream.
 *   build_export_file      turns an ENDED spool into one downloadable file
 *                          through the writer registry (writers/index.ts) and
 *                          answers the owner-only download URL.
 *   list_export_jobs       the caller's exports of this section, newest first —
 *                          how a reopened tool reconnects (the framework's
 *                          get_background_jobs knows the lane job, not the
 *                          artifact).
 *   delete_export_job      the OWNER deletes one export with all its files
 *                          before its TTL, freeing its quota bytes. Through the
 *                          owned-job door; refused (`export.artifact_busy`)
 *                          while it runs or a file is being built from it — it
 *                          never stops a job itself (stop_process does that).
 *
 * IDENTITY. The job outlives the request that started it, so everything the
 * walk needs is CAPTURED when the handler starts and handed to
 * `openExportGrid` EXPLICITLY — the principal (RE-RESOLVED when the handler
 * starts, never the submit-time one a queued job may have carried for hours:
 * currentExportPrincipal), the
 * export options (their `lang` is the data lang) and the interface lang
 * (ToolActionContext.applicationLang — captured by the executor at SUBMIT,
 * since a queued job's handler starts from another job's release). The producer builds its own identity scope
 * from those, so the spool is the same bytes in a request and in a detached
 * job (gate: tool_export_job_native.test.ts).
 *
 * OWNERSHIP. A job lives under `<root>/<userId>/<jobId>`: the caller's own
 * directory is the only one a lookup opens, so another user's job — a global
 * admin's included — is simply not there (`export.artifact_not_found`, the one
 * answer for absent / expired / not-yours). On every later read the BUILD'S
 * OWN GATES are asked AGAIN over the recorded options (access.ts
 * exportStillReadable — the same functions the build ran): a grant revoked
 * after the build closes the preview and the file too; so does a change of the
 * owner's RECORD SCOPE (projects, global admin — recorded at build as
 * manifest.record_scope) and the export's lifetime ceiling (end + TTL).
 *
 * LIFECYCLE (manifest.status): running → ended | cancelled | failed |
 * interrupted. A stop (stop_process aborts the lane job's signal; the producer
 * returns at the next record boundary with no 'end' line) deletes the
 * partial spool, marks the manifest cancelled and finishes with
 * `export.cancelled`. The SAME signal also fires for the lane deadline
 * ('failed', `export.deadline_exceeded`) and a graceful shutdown
 * ('interrupted'); the abort's cause tells them apart (abortOutcome). A failure
 * (quota, a refused gate, anything thrown) deletes the partial spool too and
 * records the error CODE and its converter-filtered details — never an
 * internal message — in the manifest; list_export_jobs serves them with the
 * registry label_key (summarizeJobError).
