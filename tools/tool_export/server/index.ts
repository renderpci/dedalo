/**
 * tool_export server module — flat-table (export_tabulator) data export.
 *
 * Every action is READ-gated on the exported section (level >= 1 on
 * options.section_tipo); the handlers add what the declarative gate cannot see.
 *
 * get_export_grid: the synchronous NDJSON stream / buffered grid (API, MCP).
 * The handler additionally asserts level >= 1 on EVERY `options.sqo.section_tipo`
 * entry (PHP assert_section_array_permission — the SQO's section list is a
 * separate, caller-supplied target set).
 *
 * components_with_parent: ontology-only lookup (which relation components point
 * at a section carrying a component_relation_parent) for the per-column
 * parents-checkbox gate (WC-049).
 *
 * THE SERVER-BUILT EXPORT (export_job.ts, preview.ts — tool_export at scale):
 *  - build_export_artifact  BACKGROUND, lane 'export': the same producer and
 *    the same SQO section gate as get_export_grid, written into the job's spool;
 *  - build_export_file      BACKGROUND, lane 'export_file': one downloadable file
 *    from an ended spool, answered as the owner-only download URL;
 *  - get_export_preview     one page of the spool (records, never split);
 *  - list_export_jobs       the caller's exports of the section (reconnect);
 *  - delete_export_job      the owner deletes one export + its files (frees
 *    quota); refused while it runs or a file is being built from it.
 * The two background actions are ADMITTED per user before the fork
 * (export_job.ts admitExportJob: at most DEDALO_EXPORT_JOBS_PER_USER queued or
 * running, else export.too_many_jobs — nothing queued; a file build also may
 * take at most every export_file slot but one, admitExportFileJob).
 * The download route (`httpRoutes`) and the TTL sweeper (`onBoot`) are
 * registered through the tool contract too, so src/ never names this tool.
 * The last four open only the CALLER's own jobs of the gated section. The
 * three READS (build_export_file, get_export_preview, list_export_jobs) also
 * re-ask the build's own read gates over the recorded options (export_job.ts
 * resolveOwnedJob → access.ts exportStillReadable — the download route asks
 * the same door). delete_export_job deliberately does NOT: it goes through the
 * discard door (export_job.ts resolveOwnedJobToDiscard — "may discard" is not
 * "may read"; the rationale lives there).
