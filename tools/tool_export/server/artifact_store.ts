/**
 * THE EXPORT ARTIFACT STORE — where tool_export's background job keeps what it
 * builds: the SPOOL (the full protocol stream, written once, read many times)
 * and the FILES built from it (csv, tsv, html, xlsx, ods, ndjson, media zip).
 *
 * LAYOUT (one directory per export, per owner):
 *
 *   <root>/<userId>/<jobId>/request.json    the IMMUTABLE request: options + read set,
 *                                           written ONCE at createJob (temp+rename)
 *                           manifest.json   owner, status, counts — the MUTABLE state
 *                                           every checkpoint rewrites (temp+rename)
 *                           grid.ndjson     EVERY protocol line, byte-identical to the
 *                                           get_export_grid stream (meta, col*, row*, end)
 *                           cols.ndjson     the 'col' lines only (the header, readable
 *                                           without scanning the grid)
 *                           grid.idx        fixed-width byte offsets: line k = offset in
 *                                           grid.ndjson of the first row of record k*R
 *                           export[_v].<ext> built files (temp+rename, never partial);
 *                                           v = a hash of the options that change the bytes
 *                           media[_v].zip   the media archive (v = the quality choice)
 *
 * THE ROOT. `config.ops.exportArtifactsDir` (DEDALO_EXPORT_ARTIFACTS_DIR, default
 * `<privateDir>/export_artifacts` — private, never web-served: every byte leaves
 * through the owner-checked download route — ENFORCED: a root that is, sits
 * inside or contains a web-served tree (the media root, the client tree;
 * symlinks followed) is refused by every writing door and the boot sweep,
 * `assertExportArtifactsPlacement`). UNDER THE TEST SEAM
 * (`DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT` set — the ONE key that arms every suite file guard,
 * src/core/media/test_media_root.ts) the seam OUTRANKS the key, exactly as it
 * outranks MEDIA_PATH, and the root is `<test media root>.export_artifacts`:
 * a sibling of the suite's own marked tree. Armed, EVERY root this store opens
 * must carry the `.dedalo_test_export_artifacts` marker or it refuses before it
 * writes — naming itself, the root, and that nothing was written. The derived
 * root is created and marked HERE, and only when the test media root it derives
 * from is itself marked (provenance: a declared test root declares its sibling);
 * a root a gate passes explicitly is never auto-marked — the gate declares it
 * (`markExportArtifactsRoot` in test/helpers/media_scratch_root.ts), the same law as
 * the media scratch roots.
 *
 * CONFINEMENT. Every path this store opens is built from validated parts
 * (`userId` a safe integer, `jobId` /^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,127}$/, a file
 * name from a closed allowlist) AND re-checked with
 * `resolve(p).startsWith(dir + sep)`; a symlink is never served. The download
 * route reuses `resolveArtifactFile` — one confinement, not two.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE. An export is a SNAPSHOT with a fixed lifetime: it expires
 * `ttlHours` after its END (finished, failed, cancelled or interrupted —
 * `exportExpired`, a HARD ceiling: a file built from it later never extends it,
 * so no export outlives its end + TTL however often files are rebuilt). An
 * expired export is not-found at every door at once (access.ts), and its
 * directory is swept — never while a file build holds a
 * live lease on it (`builds`, FileBuildLease: taken, released and consulted
 * under the manifest lock, so the sweep cannot remove a directory a build is
 * writing into, nor a file committed but not yet recorded); a RUNNING export is never touched while
 * its owner lives. It is marked `interrupted` (partial spool deleted — the user
 * runs it again, there is no resume) when its owner is certainly gone — another
 * boot wrote it and its pid is dead, or is OURS (pid reuse: a container's bun is
 * PID 1 on every start) — or when another boot's job has not heartbeaten
 * (manifest `updated_at`) for DEAD_WRITER_SILENCE_MS (1 h, the writer's cadence,
 * never the TTL). The sweep runs at boot and hourly
 * (`startExportArtifactSweeper`). The OWNER may delete an export before its
 * TTL (`deleteIdleJob`, tool_export.delete_export_job) under the SAME lock and
 * the SAME liveness rules (runningJobLive, liveBuildTemps): never while it runs
 * or a file is being built from it (`export.artifact_busy` — stop it first).
 *
 * QUOTA. The bytes one user holds under `<root>/<userId>` may not exceed
 * `quotaBytes` (DEDALO_EXPORT_ARTIFACTS_QUOTA_BYTES, 0 = off). Checked when a job
 * is created and ENFORCED while bytes are written, so an export that would
 * overflow stops with `export.artifact_quota` instead of filling the disk. The
 * budget is ONE per user, shared by every writer of that user at once (and by
 * every process on the root): a writer never spends a private snapshot; it
 * re-measures the user's directory (the truth, whoever wrote it) every
 * `quotaRecheckStep(quota)` bytes, after pushing its own buffered bytes to disk.
 * A writer's SCRATCH (an unlinked side file in the job directory, which the
 * directory measure cannot see — media_zip's failure log) is admitted through
 * the SAME meter before it is written (`FileSink.admitScratch`) and counted
 * against the quota from then on, so it never grows past the quota or the
 * volume floor either.
 * The bound is therefore quota + Σ over the user's LIVE writers of (one
 * re-check step + one unfinished spool record) — a step is quota/64 (at most
 * 16 MiB), so a few percent of the quota at worst, never N × quota.
 *
 * TWO MORE BOUNDS beside the bytes. COUNT: a user keeps at most `maxExports`
 * exports (DEDALO_EXPORT_ARTIFACTS_MAX_EXPORTS, 0 = off; `export.artifact_count`
 * at createJob) — a tiny export costs almost no bytes, yet every list and
 * reclaim reads each one. VOLUME: the quota is per user, so N users hold up to
 * N quotas; the store never lets the root's volume fall below `minFreeBytes`
 * free (DEDALO_EXPORT_ARTIFACTS_MIN_FREE_BYTES, 0 = off; `export.storage_low`),
 * checked at every writing door and by the same meter while bytes are written
 * — the default root shares ../private with the session store and settings.
 *
 * MANIFEST = request.json + manifest.json. The caller-sized part (the recorded
 * options — up to MANIFEST_OPTIONS_MAX_BYTES — and the read set derived from
 * them) never changes after createJob, so it lives in its own file, written
 * once; `manifest.json` holds only the small mutable state. A checkpoint (up
 * to 4 per second for the whole walk) rewrites a few hundred bytes, never the
 * options; a listing reads every job's small state and parses a job's options
 * only when it needs them (listJobs `where`). `readManifest` answers the
 * joined record, so readers see one ExportManifest.
 *
 * Every read-modify-write (`updateManifest`, the sweep's interrupt)
 * holds the job's `manifest.json.lock` (created atomically with its holder's
 * token, stale after 30 s, taken over and released only by token under a
 * per-instance breaker — withManifestLock), so parallel builds of one job
 * never lose each other's `files` entries, and a stale takeover never admits
 * two holders.
