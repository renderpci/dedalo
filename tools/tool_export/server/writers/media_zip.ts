/**
 * MEDIA ZIP WRITER — the server twin of render_tool_export.js `download_media`:
 * every media file the export's media columns point at, at the quality the
 * user chose per model, in ONE store-only ZIP64 archive with an `info.txt`
 * that lists what was archived and what was not (and why).
 *
 * WHAT A CELL IS TRUSTED FOR — only to NAME a record, never to name a file.
 * A candidate (a URL of a standard/value/grid cell, or a files_info file_path
 * of a dedalo_raw cell) is turned into a record address — by the media
 * file-name grammar (protection.ts MEDIA_FILENAME_GRAMMAR, the same one the
 * web-server rules use), and, for a top-level column of an export whose
 * SELECTION is one section (singleSelectionSection), by the row's own record too (a renamed file may FIT the grammar and parse
 * wrong: 'MIB_2023_45.jpg'); each address runs checks 1-3 and the first
 * whose record holds the candidate wins — and then EVERYTHING comes from the
 * database:
 *
 *   1. the component's model must be the column's media model;
 *   2. AUTHORIZATION, per file, as the job OWNER (re-resolved from the
 *      manifest, never an ambient scope): getRecordComponentPermission >= 1 on
 *      (section_tipo, component_tipo, section_id) AND principalCanAccessRecord
 *      (the projects filter). There is no media read predicate in the engine
 *      (the web server enforces media access by markers, and a logged-in user
 *      holding the media cookie reads every quality); this is STRICTER: a
 *      file is archived only when the owner could read the component on that
 *      very record. MASTERS (`original`/`modified`, protection.ts
 *      masterQualities) follow the SAME grant — no extra level — which is what
 *      the old client offered (`original` in the modal) minus every record the
 *      owner cannot read;
 *   3. the record's stored items must contain the candidate (an item whose
 *      files_info file_path the candidate ends with) — a crafted name that is
 *      not the record's own file is refused;
 *   4. the TARGET quality's file_path is READ from that item's files_info but
 *      TRUSTED only as a name inside the record's OWN folder: files_info is
 *      user-writable (the save path stores a media item as sent), so a stored
 *      path could otherwise name any file under the root — another user's
 *      import CSV, the .publication marker store — that the web server denies
 *      to everyone. The path must sit in the quality folder the media path
 *      grammar derives for the AUTHORIZED (component, section, id) at the
 *      target quality (buildMediaLocation's relativeDir — model folder,
 *      ontology media path, quality, bucket), its real path in that folder's
 *      real path (no symlink out of it); its name must not be a web-server
 *      working file (protection.ts MEDIA_WORKING_FILE_EXTENSIONS) or an
 *      active document, nor ANOTHER media record's canonical file (a name the
 *      grammar parses to a different address whose component is a media
 *      model — the bucket is shared by many records). A name the grammar does
 *      not parse to a media component stays allowed: legacy files renamed
 *      through `properties.image_id` live in that folder under any name. Then
 *      absoluteFromRelative + realpath (media-root confinement), and a
 *      regular file.
 *
 * Every refusal is listed in info.txt with a closed reason; nothing a user
 * may not read ever reaches the archive. Entries are STORED (media is already
 * compressed), streamed from disk in bounded chunks (archiveDiskFileCancellable: Stop is
 * checked per chunk), ZIP64 when a
 * size demands it (sizeHint = stat size). Names are the file's basename (the
 * client's naming: client-zip named an entry after the fetched URL's last
 * segment), duplicates renamed deterministically ('name (2).ext'); the same
 * physical file is archived once.
 *
 * `rows` in the result = media files archived (info.txt excluded).
 *
 * MEMORY: bounded by the files ARCHIVED, never by the candidates seen. The ZIP
 * central directory, the archived-file dedupe set and the "Downloaded files"
 * list are O(files archived) — inherent to the ZIP format (the central
 * directory is written last). The REFUSED candidates — which grow with the
 * selection (a quality most records lack, an owner outside most records'
 * projects) — never stay in memory: each is appended to an UNLINKED temp file
 * in the job directory (no name, so no leftover after a crash, freed when
 * closed) and streamed back into info.txt, which is itself a streamed entry.
 * The candidate memo (one DB check per distinct candidate) is a bounded window
 * of MEDIA_ZIP_MEMO_MAX candidates: a refused candidate repeated further apart
 * than that is checked, and listed, again. Nothing is O(bytes).
 *
 * DISK: the failure log is invisible to the store's quota measure (it has no
 * name) and no sink write runs while only refusals accrue, so every flush of it
 * is admitted first through the SINK's own meter (`sink.admitScratch`): the
 * user's quota counts it and the volume floor is re-checked before its bytes
 * land — `export.artifact_quota` / `export.storage_low` stop the build, never
 * a log that ran the volume down.
