/**
 * THE RE-CHECK OF A FINISHED EXPORT — the one door every later read of an
 * export asks (preview, file build, listing: export_job.ts resolveOwnedJob /
 * listOwnedExportJobs; the download route: download.ts).
 *
 * It re-asks THE BUILD'S OWN GATES over the options the manifest recorded —
 * the same functions, never a mirror of them, so the re-check can be neither
 * stricter (locking the owner out of an export it was entitled to) nor looser
 * (serving a column whose grant was revoked):
 *
 *  - the module gate: SECTION grant on `section_tipo` (every principal; an
 *    empty or non-string section_tipo is refused — nothing to check is not
 *    "allowed");
 *  - tool_export.ts `assertExportSqoSections`: SECTION grant on every
 *    `sqo.section_tipo` entry (every principal, a non-string entry refused);
 *  - the engine's declaration gate, `assertExportDeclarationReadable`
 *    (src/diffusion/export/grid.ts — Gate A + Gate B + the dedalo_raw frames,
 *    global admins exempt), the very function `openExportGrid` ran.
 *
 * Then the grants the WALK consulted beyond the declaration:
 *
 *  - its RUNTIME FRONTIER GRANTS: a stored locator may land in a section the
 *    declared ddo path never names (a multi-target portal, thesaurus terms
 *    spread over several TLD sections), and the build's frontier authorized
 *    each such (section, component) pair on the runtime identity
 *    (src/diffusion/resolve/resolver.ts assertExportCrossing →
 *    frontierComponentAllowed). The manifest records every pair it ALLOWED
 *    (`frontier_grants`) and each is re-asked through the same predicate; a
 *    manifest without the list is bound to none (fail closed). Global admins
 *    are exempt, as their walk carries no frontier.
 *
 * Then two properties of the EXPORT ITSELF, which no build gate covers:
 *
 *  - its RECORD SCOPE: the spool holds the records the owner's scope reached
 *    when the walk ran (the projects filter, the dd478 record allow-list + the
 *    runtime frontier, applied by the walk). `exportRecordScope` fingerprints
 *    that scope (global-admin flag; for everyone else the dd170 projects + the
 *    dd478 allow-list — a global admin's walk applies neither);
 *    the manifest recorded it at build, and a different answer now — the owner
 *    was removed from (or added to) a project, lost or gained global admin, or
 *    had their record allow-list changed — closes the export: every door answers not-found,
 *    nothing of the snapshot is served under a scope it was not taken for;
 *  - its LIFETIME: an export past its end + TTL (artifact_store.ts
 *    exportExpired, a hard ceiling no file build extends) is not-found at once,
 *    not at the next hourly sweep.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT RE-CHECKED: a single RECORD whose own project filing changed
 * after the walk. The export is a snapshot of what the owner could read when it
 * ran (like a file they downloaded then); the lifetime ceiling bounds how long
 * the server keeps serving it.
 *
 * A refusal (`perm.denied`) answers false; anything else propagates.
 *
 * The TOOL gate (tool_export active + authorized for the user) is NOT part of
 * this re-check: the dispatcher applies it to every action door (Gates 3+4,
 * src/core/tools/dispatch.ts) before any of them reaches here. The download
 * route is the one door the dispatcher does not front, so it asks
 * `exportToolAuthorized` itself (download.ts).
