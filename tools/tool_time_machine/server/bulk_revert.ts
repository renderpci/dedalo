/**
 * tool_time_machine.bulk_revert_process (PHP tools/tool_time_machine::
 * bulk_revert_process) — undo a whole bulk run: every component write, record
 * creation and cascade delete that carries one dd800 `bulk_process_id` (a CSV
 * import, import_execute, a propagation, an update_cache sweep, a revert).
 * The revert runs under a NEW dd800 id and writes its own undo log, so it is
 * itself exactly revertible.
 *
 * THE UNDO LOG (2026-09-27, WC-…-bulk-revert-undo-log). A run records, for
 * every key it changes, the exact region it replaced (a hidden BEFORE row,
 * tm_role 1) and the region it left (its visible after-row) — whatever the
 * caller's saveTm says (decision D1). So this door does not INFER a pre-run
 * value from history any more: it reads it. The steps:
 *   1. REFUSE A LIVE RUN (D5): a run still executing in this process, or one
 *      another revert is undoing, is refused `tool.bulk_run_live`
 *      (src/core/tools/bulk_run_registry.ts). The chain and conflict checks
 *      below are the backstop.
 *   2. LOAD every row of the run, every role, id ASC — epoch-narrowed (P0-14:
 *      a row written before an address was reborn belongs to the dead record).
 *   3. PLAN (bulk_revert_plan.ts): one KEY per component region, counted once;
 *      a dataframe main (every language) is ONE UNIT with its frames — its
 *      rows follow the TWO LANES (a language's value; the lg-nolan value +
 *      every slot's full frames), and bulk_revert_composed.ts restores them
 *      lane by lane, in one transaction.
 *   4. UNDELETE what the run's cascade deleted that no unit re-links (D3,
 *      bulk_revert_records.ts), on the record's own gate.
 *   5. REVERT each unit all-or-nothing in one transaction, NEWEST FIRST
 *      (bulk_revert_undo.ts): exact when the key has BEFORE rows, inferred
 *      (bulk_revert_legacy.ts) for a run made before the undo log. The cascade
 *      targets a unit re-links are undeleted INSIDE its transaction, first —
 *      they land or roll back with it.
 *   6. DELETE the records the run created, where that is safe (D2).
 * Observers and one activity row per written key follow each unit's COMMIT.
 *
 * PERMISSION: the module gate is section/level 2 on the request seed; a run
 * spans sections and components, so EACH unit is re-gated on every key's
 * (section_tipo, tipo) SCHEMA pair — a composed unit ALSO on every dataframe
 * slot its restore may write, which has no key of its own to be gated by —
 * AND on the record's project scope (SEC-024
 * §9.4 — the TM search applies no projects filter), skip-on-fail, never abort.
 * A unit whose OWN record the run deleted (a revert's D2 delete, reverted in
 * turn) is gated on the record's scope AFTER undeleting it, on the restored
 * row, inside its transaction — the search cannot find a row that is not there.
 * Record-level markers are gated on the section level and the record's scope,
 * the delete door's own rule.
 *
 * THE SKIP CHANNEL (SEC-16, WC-2026-09-03-bulk-revert-skipped-typed-entries,
 * amended by WC-…-bulk-revert-undo-log): `data.skipped[]` holds TYPED entries
 * `{reason, section_tipo?, tipo?, section_id?, lang?}`, never sentences. The
 * bulk id is a small enumerable integer and the run's rows are found with no
 * projects filter, so a unit's coordinates ride an entry ONLY once it has
 * passed the scope gate (`inScope`); a denial is an `out_of_scope` entry with
 * no coordinates (counted, never located); refusal TEXT (slot names, the
 * exception message) goes to the server log with the request id.
 *
 * THE REPORT: `data = {counter, unchanged, bulk_process_id, exact, skipped,
 * inexact}` — `counter` the units written, `unchanged` the KEYS already at
 * their pre-run value, `bulk_process_id` the REVERT's own id, `exact` 'full'
 * (every unit exact, nothing skipped), 'none' (nothing reverted exactly) or
 * 'partial', and `inexact[]` the writes that are not an exact inverse:
 * `legacy_inference` / `legacy_born_in_run` (a legacy key) and
 * `cascade_undelete` (the media and diffusion halves of a delete are not
 * replayed as they were), `metadata_twin` (dd199/dd200 restored and their
 * `data`-column twin RE-DERIVED from the restored value — the twin is a named
 * exemption from the undo log, bulk_revert_undo.ts rederiveMetadataTwin).
