/**
 * DATAFRAME-PAIRED TIME-MACHINE RESTORE — the frame half of a component
 * restore (PHP tools/tool_time_machine::apply_value :277-333 →
 * component_dataframe::set_time_machine_data :382).
 *
 * A main component that declares a `component_dataframe` slot does NOT store
 * its frames in its own column: they live in `relation[<slot tipo>]`, paired
 * to INDIVIDUAL main items by `id_key → id` (RELATIONS_SPEC §6.2). A restore
 * that rewrites only the main column therefore leaves the record in a state it
 * was never in — the audit's §5.6 finding on `oh1`: `oh24` (Informants)
 * reverted while `oh115` (Role) kept TODAY's frames, and every frame whose
 * `id_key` no longer matched a live main item became a permanent orphan the
 * UI can neither show nor delete.
 *
 * PHP's sequence, ported here verbatim:
 *   1. for each dataframe slot of the main component, EMPTY the slot
 *      (`empty_full_data_associated_to_main_component` removes every locator
 *      whose `from_component_tipo` is the slot — all main items, all pairings);
 *   2. replay the slot's frames as carried by the TM snapshot;
 *   3. write NO time-machine row for the slot — the main component's fresh row
 *      carries the frames (PHP `tm_record::$save_tm = false` around the slot
 *      save, and `component_common::get_time_machine_data_to_save` :1580
 *      appends every slot's FULL data to the main's snapshot; the TS capture
 *      composes the same way since 2026-09-27 — relations/dataframe_slots.ts).
 * A frame is recognised by the ONE predicate (dataframe_slots.ts
 * `isFrameEntry`, PHP `is_dataframe_entry`), the same one the TM strip
 * (tm_record.ts) partitions with: an entry restores as main data or as a frame,
 * never both and never neither.
 * Steps 1+2 collapse into ONE key write per slot here, SCOPED TO THE MAIN
 * (decision D-A, the rule the preview and the bulk revert already follow): the
 * main's own frames are replaced by the snapshot's, every other main's frames
 * in a SHARED slot stay exactly as they are live, and the key is removed only
 * when nothing is left. A composed row stores the FULL slot (PHP's shape), so
 * replacing the whole key rewound the other main's frames to that moment with
 * no history row of its own — and the preview (read.ts applyTmGraft) showed
 * them live, so Apply wrote something the operator never saw.
 *
 * THE FRAMES OF A ROW RESTORE (two lanes, apply_value): the frame state AS OF
 * the restored row replaces the main's own frames — every frame it recorded
 * comes back, a frame that pairs no item yet included (saved before its item:
 * the save order is the curator's) — except the frame of an item that existed
 * at the row and no longer exists in any language: written back, it would pair
 * nothing (isStaleItemFrame, the law the bulk revert applies too). The legacy
 * bulk path still narrows a lang-sliced key's frames with a FrameSlice (the
 * live frames of SURVIVING sibling-language items stay as they are).
 *
 * WHERE THE FRAMES COME FROM. The TM snapshot of a main component is a FLAT
 * array holding both the main items and the dd490 frame objects. Each frame
 * names its slot in `from_component_tipo`; pre-migration frames may lack it
 * and are claimed by `main_component_tipo` (PHP's dual read).
 *
 * WHY THE SLOT SET IS A UNION (deliberate divergence,
 * WC-2026-08-09-time-machine-restore-replays-paired-dataframe-frames):
 * PHP discovers slots from the main's `request_config` show map alone, which
 * misses a LITERAL main whose frames activate on `has_dataframe` + ontology
 * parentage (the two halves can legitimately disagree — see the
 * `dedalo-relations-ts` dataframe contract). A slot missed at discovery time is
 * never emptied, which is exactly the orphan this module exists to prevent, so
 * discovery unions the ontology children, the own-config ddos (show AND hide)
 * and the slots the snapshot's own frames name (model-checked before they are
 * believed).
 *
 * WHAT IS *NOT* REFUSED (PHP fidelity — the oracle handles it generically).
 * PHP never inspects a frame's `from_component_tipo` on its own: it loops the
 * slots it discovered and, for each, FILTERS the snapshot for frames naming
 * that slot. A frame naming a tipo that is not a live dataframe slot of this
 * main therefore matches no iteration, is written nowhere, and is stripped out
 * of the main data — inert, not lost (the TM row it came from is kept forever;
 * component restores never consume it). An earlier revision of this module
 * aborted such a restore, which broke the Phase-6 contract gate
 * `tool_request.test.ts` "apply_value strips dataframe frames from the restored
 * main data" — a snapshot carrying a stale/foreign frame must still restore.
 * Refusal is reserved for the one case where proceeding CORRUPTS: an
 * unattributable legacy frame with several slots in play.
 *
 * A SNAPSHOT WITH NO FRAME is not refused (decision 2026-09-28): every
 * supported row of a main is composed (PHP-era rows always carried the main +
 * all its frames; TS-era beta rows are unsupported), so its silence MEANS "no
 * frames at that time" and the plan empties the main's own frames.

 *   currently looping over. With exactly one slot the behaviour is identical;
 *   with NONE, PHP's loop never runs and the frame is inert (matched here);
 *   with SEVERAL, PHP duplicates it into every slot, so the entry is
