/**
 * BULK REVERT — one UNIT, inside one transaction (2026-09-27,
 * WC-…-bulk-revert-undo-log §2.5 step 6).
 *
 * A COMPOSED unit (a dataframe main and its frames, every lane) is
 * bulk_revert_composed.ts's. Every other unit is ONE key:
 *   1. LOCK the record row (`readMatrixKeyForUpdate`) and read the key's raw
 *      live value behind the lock. No row → the record was deleted after the
 *      run: `changed_since_run`. The revert never recreates a record (the
 *      undelete stays in dd15, where the delete's snapshot lives). EXCEPT a
 *      record the run itself created: gone is its pre-run state (a first
 *      revert deleted it, D2) — `unchanged`, so a double revert stays full.
 *   2. PLAN it — the EXACT path when the key has a BEFORE row (below), else the
 *      legacy inference (bulk_revert_legacy.ts).
 *   3. WRITE it (unless it is already at its pre-run value), then write the
 *      revert's OWN undo pair under the revert's bulk id, so reverting the
 *      revert is exact in turn.
 * Any refusal throws `RevertRefusal`, which rolls the WHOLE unit back.
 *
 * THE REVERT'S OWN HISTORY follows the two lanes like any save's (relations/
 * dataframe_slots.ts recordMainHistory): one pair per language lane it
 * changed (its value only), and one lg-nolan pair when it changed a frame or
 * the lg-nolan value — a legacy frame plan's slot writes included.
 *
 * THE EXACT PATH. The key's rows alternate BEFORE, AFTER, BEFORE, AFTER…
 * (recordBulkPair writes them in that order, one pair per write). Then:
 *   - the live region already equals the earliest BEFORE → nothing to write
 *     (`unchanged`) — decided first, see planExactKey;
 *   - CHAIN: each BEFORE equals the previous AFTER. A break means something
 *     wrote the key between two of the run's own writes and left no pair — a
 *     save with the time machine off, another run, a direct key write — so the
 *     earliest BEFORE is no longer the state the key would return to by
 *     undoing only this run: `interleaved_write`.
 *   - CONFLICT: the live region equals the LAST after-image. Otherwise the key
 *     was changed after the run, and restoring would destroy that change:
 *     `changed_since_run`.
 *   - else write `restoreLane(live, lang, earliest BEFORE)`: the live key's
 *     other-language items plus the recorded region; an ABSENT recorded key
 *     is removed, not emptied. Every region is cut with the capture's lane
 *     law (main_lanes.ts laneRegion), never a looser one.
