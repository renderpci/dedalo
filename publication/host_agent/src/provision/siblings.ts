/**
 * SEVERAL INSTANCES ON ONE HOST — what one instance may never share with another.
 *
 * derive() namespaces every path it owns by instance (config dir, agent unit, socket, sudoers
 * and polkit files), and the state-root marker refuses another instance's tree. What it cannot
 * see is the OTHER declarations: the principals, the v2 unit and the ports are the operator's
 * choice, and a collision there is either a silent failure (two v2 services on one port) or an
 * isolation hole. The hole is the users: polkit grants by subject.user and each state root is
 * owned by its agent user, so two instances sharing an agent user can each write the other's
 * media include (parsed by root at configtest) and API releases — one compromise is both.
 *
 * The v1 configuration (DB credentials included) is guarded by its OWNER, the v1 user (the
 * site's PHP-FPM pool user): behind one web server every pool shares the web server's group,
 * so the v1 user is a principal like the others — disjoint across instances. v2.group reads
 * v2/shared/v2.env: disjoint too.
 *
 * Pure, ZERO-DEPENDENCY (tests/provision_zero_dep.test.ts): the CLI reads and parses the
 * sibling declarations (schema.ts), this module only judges the derived layouts.
