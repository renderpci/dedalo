/**
 * THE SUITE DECLARES ITS CHECKOUT before any test module loads (bunfig.toml [test] preload).
 *
 * src/config.ts falls back to the committed `.env.test` under NODE_ENV=test only in a
 * checkout whose `.test-tmp/` is a real directory owned by this uid holding a real instance
 * marker (TEST_SCRATCH_MARKER) — so a DEPLOYED checkout, which has none, never boots in test
 * mode (tests/deployed_test_mode.test.ts). The fixture (tests/fixtures/instance.ts) cannot
 * plant it: it imports the config, which resolves at import. So this file does, importing
 * only the naming module (never src/config.ts).
 *
 * It never wipes: a non-empty `.test-tmp/` that does not declare the suite's instance is left
 * alone, and the config then refuses loudly — the fixture's assertDestroyable law, unchanged.
