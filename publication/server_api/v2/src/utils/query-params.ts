/**
 * The query DSL: `filter[field][op]=value` and `sort=a,-b` in, SQL fragments plus
 * bound parameters out.
 *
 * The module is deliberately two halves with a data structure between them:
 *
 *   parse  →  FilterCondition[] / OrderClause[]  →  build
 *
 * Parsing owns the GRAMMAR (what a client may write); building owns the SQL. The
 * intermediate array is what lets a service inject its own conditions — the `lang`
 * and `section_id` predicates in records.service are made with `condition()` — so
 * server-added and client-supplied filters travel the identical validate-and-bind
 * path. There is no second way to reach the WHERE clause.
 *
 * The security contract of the build half, which is the reason it exists at all:
 * a field name is an IDENTIFIER and cannot be bound as a parameter, so it is
 * re-validated here and back-tick quoted; every VALUE becomes a `?` and lives in
 * the returned params array. The two are positional and must stay together — the
 * caller appends the fragment and the params in the same order (db/query-builder).
 *
 * Note what the DSL cannot express, by design: conditions are ANDed, there is no
 * OR and no grouping. That keeps the generated WHERE flat and predictable, at the
 * cost of a query language a client cannot use to construct an arbitrary predicate.
