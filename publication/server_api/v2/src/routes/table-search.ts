/**
 * `GET /:db/tables/:table/search?q=` — relevance search over one text column.
 *
 * This is MariaDB FULLTEXT, not a LIKE scan: `MATCH(col) AGAINST(? IN BOOLEAN
 * MODE)`, ordered by descending relevance, with the score exposed to the client
 * as a `relevance` field on each row. Boolean mode means `q` is a query
 * LANGUAGE (`+must`, `-not`, `"phrase"`) rather than a literal string — which
 * is the sharp edge against the fragment routes, where `terms` is matched
 * literally. The two are not interchangeable.
 *
 * The search column is a client parameter (`?column=`, default `transcription`)
 * because which column is worth indexing is a per-publication decision. It must
 * exist AND carry a FULLTEXT index; both failures are the CLIENT's problem and
 * come back as a 400 (the service translates MariaDB errno 1191 rather than
 * letting it escape as a 500).
 *
 * Rows also carry `fragments` — highlighted excerpts — but with a FIXED window
 * (320 chars, 3 occurrences) that no query parameter can tune. Tuning is what
 * the per-record fragments route is for.
 *
 * Envelope and pagination are the same as the record list (data + pagination +
 * an RFC 8288 `Link` header), so a client can page search hits with the same
 * code it pages records.
