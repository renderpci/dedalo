/**
 * The input contract: every value a client can send, and the only place it is decided
 * whether that value is acceptable.
 *
 * These schemas are the API's outer boundary. A route hands raw query params straight to
 * one of them and works with the parsed result afterwards, so anything a handler receives
 * has already been coerced to its real type and bounded. A ZodError thrown from here is
 * turned into a 400 problem+json with a per-field `errors` array by the error handler —
 * which is why no validator needs to build an error response itself.
 *
 * What is NOT decided here: SQL-identifier safety. `column`, `fields` and `sort` are plain
 * strings at this layer, and are checked against the identifier grammar (and against the
 * table's real columns) at the SQL boundary in db/query-builder.ts. That is deliberate —
 * identifier validation belongs at the one chokepoint that interpolates, not scattered
 * across every schema that happens to accept a column name.
 *
 * Bounds imported from constants.ts rather than written inline, so the documented limit and
 * the enforced limit are the same number.

/**
 * THE BOUNDED PARAMETERS — one object per client-supplied number or string that carries a
 * DoS bound, exported so that EVERY entry layer parses the SAME schema object.
 *
 * This is the fix for the shape of defect PUB-06: the caps used to live only in the
 * route-level schemas below, and mcp/tools.ts declared its own `z.number()` for the same
 * parameter — so the MCP door, which is enabled and unauthenticated by default, handed a
 * raw `limit` to SQL. A cap that one door can decline to import is not a bound.
 *
 * Identity, not spelling, is the contract: mcp/tools.ts imports these very objects (the
 * `.optional()`/`.describe()` wrappers below are built here too, so the tool shapes ARE
 * these objects), and the gate asserts object identity as well as behaviour. A second
 * copy of the same numbers elsewhere would satisfy a grep and defeat the invariant.
 *
 * Refusal, not clamping, is the answer at this layer — see the note on MAX_LIMIT in
 * constants.ts. The service layer clamps as well (db/query-builder.ts), so a caller that
 * never passes through a schema still cannot exceed the bound; refuse is the contract,
 * clamp is the floor beneath it.
