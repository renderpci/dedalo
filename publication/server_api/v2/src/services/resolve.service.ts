/**
 * Relation resolution: turning the ids a published row CARRIES into the rows they POINT AT.
 *
 * The diffusion process flattens Dédalo's relational graph into standalone tables, and a
 * relation survives as a JSON array of `section_id`s sitting inside a TEXT column. A
 * client that wants the related rows would otherwise have to read that array and issue a
 * second request per column. These two functions do that server-side, in one round trip.
 *
 * TWO DIRECTIONS, and they are not symmetric:
 *
 *   - FORWARD (`resolveRelations`, `?resolve_relations`) — outbound. The caller names the
 *     columns to expand and the table each one points at, because nothing in the cell
 *     itself says where its ids live. Any column, any table.
 *
 *   - INVERSE (`resolveInverseRelations`, `?resolve_inverse_relations`) — inbound. Always
 *     and only the `dd_relations` column, which diffusion fills with LOCATORS of the
 *     records that point AT this one: `{section_tipo, section_id}`. `section_tipo` is an
 *     ontology type ("rsc170"), not a table, so a map is still needed to land it — but
 *     that map is a property of the publication, not of the request, so `true` loads it
 *     from the `publication_schema` table and the caller supplies nothing.
 *
 * CONTRACT — resolution is DECORATION, never a failure mode. A cell that cannot be
 * resolved (unparseable, wrong shape, target table absent, query fails) is left exactly as
 * it was, and the request still succeeds with the rest of its data. Every `catch` in this
 * file is that promise, not a swallowed bug. Consequently a client must always be prepared
 * to see the raw id array it asked to have expanded.
 *
 * BOUNDS — resolution is client-directed fan-out, so it is capped in both dimensions:
 * MAX_RESOLVE_DEPTH (3) on nesting and MAX_RESOLVE_ROWS (50) on ids per cell. See the
 * comments at each site; together they are what keeps one cheap-looking request from
 * turning into thousands of queries.
 *
 * MUTATION — the row objects are written IN PLACE (the arrays are shallow-copied, the rows
 * inside them are not). Rows here are freshly fetched per request and owned by the caller
 * that just built them, so this is safe; it is the same bargain utils/parse-json makes.
