/**
 * Resolving an INDEXATION LOCATOR to a playable audiovisual fragment.
 *
 * This is the endpoint a thesaurus-driven front end lives on. In Dédalo, indexing an
 * interview means tagging a stretch of its transcription with a thesaurus term; what the
 * publication stores is a locator — `{section_id, section_tipo, component_tipo, tag_id,
 * tc_in, tc_out}` — that pins one term to one timed passage of one record. A client
 * browsing the thesaurus holds locators and nothing else, and asks this service to turn
 * one into something a user can watch and read.
 *
 * Assembling the answer means reaching across the published schema: the interview row
 * carries the transcription, the media row carries the video file, the speaker row carries
 * who is talking, and the thesaurus tables carry the terms indexed at that same tag. Hence
 * a three-table LEFT JOIN plus a separate terms lookup — LEFT because a fragment is still
 * worth serving when the media or the speaker was not published.
 *
 * Contrast search.service's `avFragments`, which SEARCHES a record's transcription for
 * words. Here nothing is searched: the locator already says which passage, and the work is
 * cutting it out (extractTranscriptionFragment) and dressing it with terms and media URLs.

/**
 * Cut the words spoken during a timecode window out of a whole transcription.
 *
 * A Dédalo transcription is one long text carrying INLINE MARKERS: `[tc-in-out]` opens a
 * timed segment (so a marker PRECEDES the speech it times), and `[page-n-N]` marks page
 * breaks. Nothing in the database indexes those positions — the timeline exists only as
 * text — so mapping a `tc_in`/`tc_out` window onto characters means walking the markers,
 * which is what the scan below does: find the segment whose range covers `tc_in`, keep
 * scanning until a segment reaches `tc_out`, and slice between the two.
 *
 * The markers are then STRIPPED, along with the whitespace their removal leaves behind:
 * the caller asked for a passage to display next to a video, not for Dédalo's annotation
 * syntax. (The `tc_in`/`tc_out` the caller already holds are echoed back in `media`, so
 * nothing is lost by removing them from the prose.)
 *
 * Degradation is toward "everything" rather than "nothing": an unannotated transcription, or
 * a locator that carries no window at all, yields the whole text — a usable answer either way.
 *
 * THIS WAS BROKEN, and the endpoint looked healthy while it was — worth knowing, because the
 * failure was silent rather than loud. The old scan closed the window only `if (fragmentStart
 * > 0)`, so a window opening at the first marker (index 0 — where a transcription that starts
 * with a timecode puts it, and where the default `tc_in = 0` lands) never closed, and the
 * entire remaining transcription came back. For any later window it was worse: the marker that
 * opened the segment was also the one that closed it, so the slice contained nothing but the
 * marker itself, which the strip then removed — and the caller got an EMPTY STRING.
