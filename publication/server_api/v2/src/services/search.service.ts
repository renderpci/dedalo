/**
 * The three search surfaces, all read-only:
 *
 *   - `fulltextSearch`  — find records: MariaDB `MATCH … AGAINST` over a FULLTEXT-indexed
 *                         column, ranked by relevance.
 *   - `textFragments`   — find passages inside ONE known record (books, theses), with page
 *                         references from Dédalo's `[page-n-N]` markers.
 *   - `avFragments`     — the same, for an audiovisual record: passages carry the
 *                         `[tc-in-out]` timecode window, so the answer is a video clip.
 *
 * The division of labour matters: the DATABASE decides which records match (that is what
 * the FULLTEXT index is for), and JAVASCRIPT cuts the excerpts (utils/fragments) — the
 * index can rank a document but cannot hand back a windowed, `<mark>`-highlighted
 * passage. So the fragment functions never search; they fetch one row and scan it, which
 * is why they take a `section_id` rather than a query.
 *
 * Every entry point asserts the table (and, where it interpolates one, the column) exists
 * before composing SQL — see schema.service for why that ordering is the security story.
