/**
 * THE STAMP GATE — the properties `src/provision/hash.ts` has to keep for the provisioner
 * to be safe to run twice.
 *
 * The provisioner writes only on drift, as root, on a host with a museum's live public site
 * on it. Every one of those words rests on the stamp: the first line of each generated file
 * carries the sha256 of everything below it, so a later run can tell "we changed the
 * renderer" (safe: rewrite) from "somebody edited this file" (not safe: report, refuse).
 * Four properties make that distinction real, and each has a test below:
 *
 *   1. ROUND TRIP — what `stamp()` writes, `parseStamp()` reads back, body byte for byte.
 *      Without it every artifact is a hand edit the moment it is read.
 *   2. THE STAMP LINE IS NOT IN THE HASH. It cannot be (the line holds the hash), and the
 *      consequence is load-bearing: renaming a kind or moving an instance leaves the file's
 *      CONTENT unchanged, so it must not read as drift.
 *   3. DRIFT IS DETECTED — any change to the body, and any tampering with the recorded
 *      hash. This is the only mechanism protecting a hand-tuned vhost from being silently
 *      overwritten.
 *   4. AN UNSTAMPED OR CORRUPT FILE RETURNS null, NEVER A THROW. The caller is walking a
 *      real host: a hand-written vhost from before this subsystem existed, a truncated
 *      file, a binary blob at a path the declaration now claims. Those are the normal
 *      contents of a host, and the answer needed is "not ours" — actionable, not thrown.
 *
 * Pure gate over pure functions: nothing here touches the filesystem.
