/**
 * THE REAL HOST I/O — the seam `tests/provision_apply.test.ts` deliberately replaces.
 *
 * That gate drives every apply through a FAKE `ProvisionIo`, which is right: it is about
 * the PLAN, and a plan gate that touched a real machine could not run in a suite. But it
 * means `hostIo()` itself — the only code in the subsystem that writes to a host — was
 * never executed by anything. Coverage said so: the whole function was unrun, and the
 * chown-failure throw survived a mutation sweep. It is the same shape as the earlier
 * parseManifest-vs-derive defect, one altitude up: a gate that routes around the thing it
 * is named for.
 *
 * The `$2y$` prefix was the sharpest case. `tests/provision_apply.test.ts` asserts it
 * against `const HASH_PREFIX = '$2y$fake$'` — a value the test itself computes and its own
 * fake returns — so an htpasswd full of `$2b$` hashes, which not every crypt(3) a museum's
 * distro ships will accept, would have shipped green.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT DO. It writes into its own scratch corner as the user
 * running the suite: modes, atomicity, the hash and the exec wrapper are all real here.
 * `chown` to another owner is not — that needs root — so the chown assertion is the one
 * that matters without it: a chown that FAILS must throw rather than be quietly skipped,
 * which is provable by naming an owner that does not exist.
