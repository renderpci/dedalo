/**
 * THE SHIPPED FIRST-PARTY TEXT TREES — the roots a gate scans when the question
 * is "does anything we ship SAY this", in ONE place.
 *
 * Six trees carry text that reaches a user or an operator: the two browser
 * trees (client/, tools/), the engine (src/), its scripts (scripts/), the
 * read-only publication subsystem (publication/) and the deploy templates
 * (deploy/). docs/ is deliberately NOT among them — the manual may quote a URL
 * as example data, so a gate that forbids a spelling elsewhere must not read it
 * there.
 *
 * `census_derivation_tripwire` refuses a gate that writes such a root set
 * in-file (the subset-root defect class: a gate green over the wrong
 * directory), which is why the list lives here and is registered in that gate's
 * SHARED_LISTERS.
 *
 * Consumers: test/unit/docs_versioning_tripwire.test.ts.
