/**
 * THE MEASURED PROCESS of diffusion_artifact_rss_native (PERF-2/DIFF-4).
 *
 * A peak-RSS ceiling can only be measured in a process that does ONE thing:
 * the peak RSS is a high-water mark (KiB) of the whole process (peakKiB), so
 * the gate spawns this file per measurement and reads the delta it prints as
 * the last stdout line (JSON). The BASELINE is the CURRENT resident
 * size after a full GC (`process.memoryUsage().rss`), never the high-water mark
 * itself: a phase before the measured one (the rdf mode's writes) may have
 * peaked higher than where the process now sits, and measuring from that peak
 * would hide every byte the measured step grows back up to it. Modes:
 *
 *   control <file>            read the file WHOLE — the positive control proving
 *                             the unit and the probe (its delta must be large);
 *   zip <out.zip> <file>...   the production `createZip` over big files;
 *   rdf-write <count> <bytes> an rdf writer session writes <count> records of
 *                             ~<bytes> each (batches of 10, GC between them)
 *                             through `writeRows` — the production record files;
 *   rdf-close <count>         a FRESH session (same plan, same job) runs `close()`
 *                             — the consolidation (merge + zip) — over them, from
 *                             the BASELINE: the measured delta is close()'s alone.
 *
 * TWO PROCESSES, because maxRSS is a LIFETIME high-water mark nothing resets: in
 * one process the write phase's peak (measured 920 MiB on Linux in the CI image,
 * 2026-10-01 — the process then sat at 54 MiB) was reported as close()'s growth.
 * The close gets the synthetic run context the runner passes (the artifact
 * manifest = every record written, in order), so it consolidates files another
 * process wrote — a close that consolidated only its own writes would archive
 * nothing, and the gate's archive check (every record named, CRCs) reds it.
 *
 * The environment is the parent's (DEDALO_DIFFUSION_FILES_ROOT points at a
 * MARKED scratch root; the test media guard is inherited armed).
