/**
 * A GATE THAT SUBSTITUTES A CLIENT MODULE RUNS IN ITS OWN PROCESS.
 *
 * WHY. `bun test` runs every file of a tier in ONE process, and the two ways a
 * gate replaces a browser module — `mock.module` and `Bun.plugin` — are
 * process-global: `mock.restore()` does not revert a module mock, a plugin
 * cannot be unregistered (and survives `--isolate`), and the client modules
 * under test (`common.js`, `component_common.js`, `instances.js` …) are loaded
 * ONCE per process, binding whichever `ui.js` / `events.js` stub was live at
 * that moment. So each client gate measured the stubs of whatever client gate
 * ran before it: green on the Mac, whose readdir is alphabetical, and ~30 reds
 * in the CI image, whose readdir is hash-ordered (measured 2026-10-02 — the
 * upload queue, the data-model guard, the info widget, the render queue, the
 * in-flight registry, the build-failure panel, the TM list and section_record
 * rows). Every earlier repair re-masked the module in the victim and left the
 * same shape of leak behind (transcription_status_panel says so in its own
 * comments); the class only ends when the substitution cannot outlive its file.
 *
 * HOW. The gate's file is loaded twice:
 *   - in the tier's process it registers NOTHING of its own: `mirrorIsolatedGate`
 *     runs `bun test ./<file>` in a child (repo root, so bunfig's preloads arm the
 *     suite database and media root exactly as for any test; `childEnv()` strips
 *     the per-run seams a child must re-derive), parses the child's JUnit, and
 *     registers one case per child case under the SAME full name, asserting the
 *     child's verdict with the child's failure text;
 *   - in the child (`isIsolatedGateChild` true) the real body registers and runs,
 *     alone in its process.
 * The child runs with Bun's on-disk transpiler cache OFF (see runIsolated): that
 * cache bakes plugin-resolved imports into a module's cached build and serves
 * them to every later process, so without it isolation by process isolates
 * nothing.
 * A mirrored case re-executes its `expect` as many times as the child case
 * executed assertions, so the per-file assertion floor (red_baseline per_file)
 * keeps measuring the child's real count — a child that asserts less makes the
 * parent assert less. A child that crashed or reported no case is ONE failing
 * case carrying its stderr tail — never a silent pass.
 *
 * Gate: mock_isolation_tripwire (rule 4) — every test file that substitutes a
 * client module in-process (mock.module of a client/ or tools/ path, or a
 * Bun.plugin) is an isolated gate.
