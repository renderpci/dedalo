/**
 * THE ONE PLACE THE TEST MEDIA ROOT'S PATH IS DERIVED — the filesystem twin of
 * `test/helpers/test_database.ts`, shared by the three processes that must agree
 * about it: the `bun test` preload (`test/preload/test_media.ts`), the builder
 * (`scripts/test_db_setup.ts`, which SWEEPS and rebuilds it) and the client
 * suite's own server (`scripts/client_test_server.ts`).
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY THERE.
 *
 *   <repo>/../private/test_media/<suite database name>/
 *
 * Three properties decide that path, in this order:
 *
 *  1. `../private/` IS ALREADY THE HOME OF PER-INSTALL, NON-SERVED, NON-REPO
 *     STATE — `.env`, the session store, `processes/`, `ts_state.json`. It is
 *     outside every web root by construction (the media-protection subsystem
 *     relies on exactly that for the auth store), outside the repo, and it is
 *     the directory an operator already knows is "this checkout's private
 *     scratch". A test media tree is precisely that kind of thing.
 *  2. KEYED BY THE SUITE DATABASE NAME, because the media tree and the database
 *     are ONE fixture: `files_info.file_path` rows in the database name files in
 *     the tree. Two checkouts, or one checkout with `DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE`
 *     pointed somewhere else, get two trees and never plant one corpus's files
 *     where the other's rows expect them. It is also the reason a rebuild of the
 *     database rebuilds the tree in the same command.
 *  3. IT CANNOT COLLIDE WITH THE INSTALLATION'S `MEDIA_PATH`. The install root is
 *     `<projectRoot>/media` by default and an operator-chosen absolute path
 *     otherwise; neither is ever inside `../private/test_media/`. {@link
 *     assertDistinctFromInstallMediaRoot} proves it rather than assuming it —
 *     the derivation is a convention, and a convention is what the
 *     `.dedalo_test_media` marker exists to stop us from trusting.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE MAY IMPORT. `src/config/env.ts` only, exactly like its
 * database twin: it is loaded BEFORE the process is repointed, and pulling in
 * `src/config/config.ts` would freeze the media root (and the DB connection) at
 * the installation's values before the seam could be set.

 * importing it HERE would freeze the config (media root and DB connection alike)
 * at the installation's values before the preload could repoint them, which is
 * the same reason `test/helpers/test_database.ts` does not re-export the database
 * guard. `test/unit/test_media_root_tripwire.test.ts` asserts the two literals are
