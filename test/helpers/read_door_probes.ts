/**
 * READ_DOOR_PROBED — the bridge between READ_DOOR_POSTURE's `component` rows
 * (src/core/security/read_door.ts) and the behavioural legs that exercise them
 * (test/unit/read_door_acl_native.test.ts), closure Step 3.
 *
 * A posture row's `gate: READ_DOOR_GATE` is a LABEL; on its own it proves
 * nothing (relabelling a row is a one-word edit no gate noticed). So:
 *
 *   - the authorization-door matrix (authz_door_matrix_native) counts a
 *     `component` row as DELEGATED only when its key is in READ_DOOR_PROBED;
 *   - read_door_acl_native registers each door here as its leg COMPLETES (after
 *     every assertion of the pair passed — `markReadDoorProbed`), and its last
 *     test asserts the set of completed doors EQUALS READ_DOOR_PROBED.
 *
 * So a row relabelled `component` without a leg is red in the matrix, and a key
 * added here without a leg that runs to completion is red in the native gate.
 *
 * Lives in a helper, not in either test file: a test file imported by another
 * registers its tests twice.
