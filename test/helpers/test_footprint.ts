/**
 * TEST-FILE FOOTPRINT — what a test file can TOUCH, derived from its source,
 * never from a hand list.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Phase 3 shard runner (scripts/test_shard.ts) runs test
 * files in N concurrent `bun test` child processes, each on its own cloned
 * database. Before it may do that it has to know, per file, which shared
 * surfaces the file reaches: a file that spawns its own subprocess, a file that
 * writes the suite media tree, a file whose imports the scanner cannot even
 * resolve. Guessing is how the 2026-08-19 era ended (a gate deleted a real
 * ontology node, test218, out of a live install because nobody had derived what
 * it touched), so the classification is DERIVED: walk the transitive import
 * graph with the EXISTING `extractImportSpecifiers` from
 * `test/helpers/no_write_scan.ts` — the one extractor that already covers
 * dynamic `import()`, the exact hole that once let a full matrix write past a
 * no-write gate; this module deliberately does NOT grow a second extractor —
 * then literal-scan every reached file for the surface signals below.
 *
 * THE BANDS (bandOf):
 *   A — pure/static: no DB, no filesystem/process effects seen. Safe anywhere.
 *   B — filesystem / scratch-media / process effects, but DB-free.
 *   C — DB-touching: the corpus doors, zz* scratch TLDs, the canonical test3
 *       records, the diffusion table seams, the SHARED suite media root (which
 *       is keyed by the database name and therefore moves WITH the database),
 *       a reachable pool — or anything the scanner could not resolve.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, LOUDLY. An import specifier that does not resolve to a file on
 * disk lands the whole file in band C AND pins it, with the offending
 * `from -> specifier` edge recorded in `unresolvedImports` so the refusal can
 * name it. Guessing narrower would be silently narrowing scope (hard rule).
 *
 * PINNED IS STRONGER THAN BAND C. Any file whose test-side source matches
 * `Bun.spawn` / `process.execPath` is PINNED regardless of its DB
 * classification: a spawned child reaches Postgres with whatever env it
 * inherits and evades every in-process role guard, so such a file runs only in
 * the shard runner's BASE bin — the one whose environment is byte-identical to
 * today's serial run. The spawn scan covers the test file and its `test/`
 * import closure, not `src/`: an engine spawn site executes INSIDE the child's
 * fully-composed environment, while a test-authored spawn is the test choosing
 * its own env — the hazard being censused.
 *
 * MEDIA IS TWO DIFFERENT SURFACES, ON PURPOSE. Reaching
 * `test/helpers/media_scratch_root.ts` means per-call `mkdtemp` roots that two
 * processes can never collide on (band B). Reaching `src/core/media/**`,
 * `test/helpers/test_media_root.ts` or the `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT` seam means
 * the SHARED suite media tree — one fixture with the suite database
 * (`files_info` rows name files in it), so it classifies with the database
 * (band C) and follows a shard's database automatically
 * (`testMediaRootPath()` derives the tree from the database name).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, stated plainly:
 *  - It reads SOURCE, not runtime behaviour. A surface reached through an
 *    argv-assembled spawn of an arbitrary script, or a tipo assembled from
 *    fragments, is invisible to the literal scans; the unresolved-import rule
 *    catches only the IMPORT-shaped half of that hole.
 *  - Band A means "no effect signal SEEN", not "provably pure". The fs/process
 *    literal scan covers test-side files only (see above), so a test that
 *    reaches the filesystem exclusively through a `src/` module it imports can
 *    classify A. That is acceptable for the consumer this exists for — the
 *    shard runner gives EVERY bin a full database and media tree, so an
 *    under-banded file is mis-labelled, not mis-scheduled.
 *  - Co-location constraints (which files must share ONE bin) are NOT here:
 *    that is `scripts/lib/test_components.ts`'s union-find census, and the
 *    partitioner consumes both.
 *
 * HERMETIC: filesystem reads of tracked source. No DB, no network.
