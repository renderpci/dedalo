/**
 * THE BROWSER CORPUS — the one lister that owns the browser trees.
 *
 * `client/` and `tools/**\/js` are source (AGENTS.md: the client is the
 * PRIMARY, TS-OWNED client source), so every gate that scans them must scan
 * the SAME files. Three gates each grew their own walk — a corpus that can
 * drift per gate is a census nobody can trust, and `census_derivation_tripwire`
 * refuses a gate that chooses its own root in-file. This module owns the roots;
 * the gates import a shape and never name a directory.
 *
 * Two shapes, because the two censuses are legitimately different:
 *   `browserSources()`        — git's view: tracked AND untracked (a module not
 *                               yet `git add`ed is still SERVED), never ignored.
 *   `firstPartyClientFiles()` — the on-disk walk of first-party code only: the
 *                               app client plus every tool client, with the
 *                               vendored, test and server subtrees skipped —
 *                               and, like git's view, never an IGNORED file
 *                               (a developer's `client/dedalo/dev_tools/` is
 *                               theirs, not the engine's: it made
 *                               render_escape_tripwire red on one machine).
