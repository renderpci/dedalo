/**
 * DD128_PROBED — the bridge between the dd128 write census
 * (test/unit/dd128_write_census_tripwire.test.ts) and the authorization-door
 * matrix (test/unit/authz_door_matrix_native.test.ts), closure Step 3.
 *
 * A census row may claim the verdict `delegates` — "this file's dd128-reachable
 * writes are authorized by the write door (security/write_door.ts), which
 * applies the own-record rule" — ONLY when the claim is MEASURED: the file is a
 * key here, and every matrix door listed for it runs the DD1725 leg (a
 * `(dd128, dd1725)` user-manager addressing their OWN account) and must answer
 * `refused`. The census asserts the membership; the matrix asserts the outcome.
 * A spelling (an import of write_door) is never the evidence on its own.
 *
 * Lives in a helper, not in either test file: a test file imported by another
 * registers its tests twice.
