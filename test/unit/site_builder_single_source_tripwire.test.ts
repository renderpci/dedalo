/**
 * SITE-BUILDER SINGLE-SOURCE TRIPWIRE — the general gate for the defect this subsystem has
 * now produced FIVE times: ONE FACT, DERIVED IN TWO PLACES.
 *
 * ── THE FIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. `schema.ts` and `layout.ts` each owned the constants, with DIFFERENT bounds — so a
 *      manifest could pass one and be refused by the other.
 *   2. The daemon derived `<base>/<domain>` while the provisioner honoured
 *      `sites[].webspace`. On the committed reference declaration the two disagreed: the
 *      vhosts served `/srv/legacy-www/archive-example`, the daemon published into
 *      `/home/www/archive.example.net`. Every file on the host was correct and the museum's
 *      page simply never changed.
 *   3. `contentfulPaths()` was a hand-kept census of the rendered artifacts beside
 *      `RENDERERS`, and had already drifted: `sites.json` was written once and never
 *      drift-checked again — a hand edit to the file that tells the daemon where every
 *      museum's webspace is would have been invisible to `provision check`.
 *   4. `isAvailable()` kept its own opinion of "configured" (`url && token`) while the
 *      resolver said otherwise, so the tool hid itself on exactly the topology the
 *      provisioner delivers.
 *   5. Found BY THIS GATE, on the run that first measured the census:
 *      `tools/tool_sitebuilder/server/index.ts` declared its own `DOMAIN_PATTERN`,
 *      documented as "deliberately not stricter" than the owner's and stricter in two ways
 *      — four characters minimum against one, and a `[a-z]{2,63}` final label against any
 *      label. `a.b` and `x.123` are domains the provisioner builds a webspace and two
 *      vhosts for and the museum's only door refused to create a site on.
 *
 * Every one was invisible to a green suite, and every fix DELETED a derivation rather than
 * making one more careful. What no individual fix can do is stop the sixth.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GATE IS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the one that makes the first honest.
 *
 *   A. A SHRINK-ONLY CENSUS, in the shape `generic_tld_tripwire` uses: for each fact, the
 *      files entitled to derive it, frozen in `engineering/site_builder_single_source_baseline.json`
 *      with a REASON per owner. Growth is red, staleness is red, an owner with no reason is
 *      red. So a NEW second census is red BY DEFAULT — which is the whole point: the gate
 *      does not know what the sixth defect will be, only what shape it will have.
 *   B. BEHAVIOURAL ASSERTIONS for the facts that can be asked of running code, because a
 *      source census cannot see a derivation spelled some other way. The observer's
 *      contentful set is measured by RUNNING `observeHost` over a real host tree; the
 *      transport's single owner is proved by asking every consumer the same question; the
 *      fingerprint's two spellings are RUN side by side.
 *
 * ── ONE IMPLEMENTATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file COMPUTES NO CENSUS. It imports `scripts/lib/site_builder_census.ts` (the
 * measure) through `scripts/site_builder_single_source_baseline.ts` (the generator/drift
 * checker). A gate that re-implemented the scan would be a second census of the second
 * censuses.
 *
 * HERMETIC: no database, no `../private`, no network. It writes only into its own scratch
 * directory under the OS temp root and removes it again.
