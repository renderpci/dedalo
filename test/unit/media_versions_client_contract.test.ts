/**
 * The media-versions PANEL's three client-side contracts with the engine.
 *
 * All were invisible from the server side — the
 * build really did succeed, the API really did answer 'ok', and the panel still
 * sat blinking "Processing" forever. What failed was the completion step.
 *
 * 1. NO 'force_save'. PHP's panel finished a build by asking the component to
 *    save, so the new files_info would reach the record. The TS engine persists
 *    it on the build path itself, and `saveComponentData` REFUSES unknown save
 *    actions loudly — so that call could only ever 500. Asserted from both ends:
 *    the engine still refuses it (the refusal is the contract, not an accident),
 *    and no client sends it.
 *
 * 2. The refresh after a mutation must NOT destroy dependencies. The default
 *    `refresh()` destroys them, which nulls `main_element.context` — and the
 *    grid's re-render reads `main_element.context.features.default_quality` on
 *    its first line, so it threw before repainting a single cell. Every
 *    mutating path in the panel (build, delete_version, delete_quality,
 *    sync_files) therefore passes `destroy: false`.
 *
 * 3. BOTH SIDES OF THE UNSYNC COMPARISON COME FROM ONE ANSWER. The panel warns
 *    "files info data is unsync" when the record's stored files_info and the
 *    disk scan disagree. It took the disk side live and the DB side from the
 *    COMPONENT'S CACHED DATA — a snapshot from when the tool opened that no
 *    refresh re-reads — so every delete raised a warning about a record that was
 *    perfectly in sync, and a page reload made it vanish. `get_files_info` now
 *    returns `files_info_db` beside the scan, and the client reads the DB side
 *    only from there. Gated on the SERVER side (the field is emitted, and it is
 *    the stored value, not the scan) because that is the half a refactor would
 *    quietly drop.
 *
 * Static source assertions where the subject is vanilla JS with no DOM harness
 * in this suite — these are exactly the lines a future edit would silently
 * reintroduce.
