/**
 * component_section_id search binds — the placeholder must carry its own cast.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS (found live 2026-08-06, present since the initial TS
 * rewrite): `builder_section_id` emitted `<alias>.section_id::integer = $N`
 * and bound the digit string UNCAST. On its own that is harmless — Postgres
 * infers an untyped parameter as integer from context — which is exactly why
 * every SQL-BUILDING test passed and the defect shipped.
 *
 * It detonates when the SAME literal is also used by a TEXT predicate:
 * `ParamsCollector.getPlaceholder` dedupes by strict value (params.ts), so
 * searching a text component for '5555' AND the record id for '5555' collapses
 * both onto ONE placeholder. That placeholder is then `text` for one predicate
 * and `integer` for the other, and the whole query dies with
 *   operator does not exist: integer = text
 * — a 500, not an empty result. Reported as "the combination of Catalogue and
 * Id fails" on numisdata161 while each field worked alone.
 *
 * These tests therefore EXECUTE the SQL. Building it is not enough: a
 * build-only assertion cannot see a type error that only Postgres raises.
