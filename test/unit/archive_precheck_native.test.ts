/**
 * AN ARCHIVE IS REFUSED BEFORE IT IS UNPACKED, NOT AFTER (P2-7 / DOS-07).
 *
 * `extractArchive` spawned `unzip -o -q` and let it run to completion. The only
 * uncompressed-size bound (1 GiB) was summed inside `walk(destDir)` AFTER unzip
 * had written every byte — so the cap described a disk that was already full.
 *
 * That is not a theoretical ordering problem: `renameSwap`'s same-device
 * requirement GUARANTEES the staging directory shares the install's volume, so
 * a zip bomb fills the LIVE volume of a running heritage install and the
 * refusal arrives after the damage.
 *
 * `preValidateArchive` already checked entry NAMES and symlink MODES, and the
 * verbose `zipinfo` output it already spawned carries the DECLARED UNCOMPRESSED
 * SIZE in its fourth column. The bound now runs there — one more pass over text
 * we already had, not another spawn.
 *
 * The post-extraction sum STAYS where it was. The two catch different things: a
 * declared size can lie, and a bomb that announces itself honestly is refused
 * before it costs anything. Belt and brace, in that order.
 *
 * These tests build REAL archives with the system `zip` and feed them to the
 * REAL door — no fixture, no mock, nothing that could pass by describing the
 * check instead of running it.
