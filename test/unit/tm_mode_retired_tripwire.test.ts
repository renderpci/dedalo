/**
 * TRIPWIRE — the ddo/display mode 'tm' stays retired
 * (WC-2026-08-14-tm-ddo-mode-retired).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `'tm'` used to mean two unrelated things at once: a ROW
 * SOURCE (read from matrix_time_machine rather than matrix) and a RENDER MODE
 * stamped on every dd15 ddo, context entry and data item. The second meaning
 * bought nothing — all 29 client `prototype.tm` slots were verbatim copies of
 * their `prototype.list` twin — while costing everything: each generic per-cell
 * policy gates on `ddoMode === 'list'`, so a synonym of `list` silently opted
 * dd15 out of ALL of them. That is how a Time Machine cell came to render a
 * 101 KB transcript raw where the section's own list rendered a 130-char
 * preview.
 *
 * A mode that is a synonym of `list` in every renderer is not a mode; it is a
 * hole in every policy keyed to `list`. Deleting it closes the hole BY
 * CONSTRUCTION — but only for as long as nobody reintroduces the token. Hence a
 * grep gate rather than a behavioural one: the failure this guards against is
 * someone writing `mode: 'tm'` again, and no behavioural test can see that
 * coming.
 *
 * THE SURVIVING MEANING. `sqo.mode === 'tm'` is untouched and load-bearing: it
 * is what routes a read to the matrix_time_machine backend. Setting it to
 * 'list' returns the caller section's LIVE records instead of its history —
 * silently, with no error, a correct-looking list of the wrong rows (this
 * happened once during the unification and is why the base SQO now carries an
 * inline warning). Read-only provenance travels on `source.data_source === 'tm'`
 * plus the server-stamped `consultation_only` section flag.

 *
 * Every entry here is a ROW SOURCE (or an input alias for one). None is a render
 * mode. Adding an entry is a deliberate act that must say which it is.
