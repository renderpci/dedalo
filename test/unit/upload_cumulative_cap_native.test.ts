/**
 * MEDIA-03 — A CHUNKED UPLOAD IS CAPPED BY ITS ASSEMBLED SIZE, NOT ITS CHUNK COUNT.
 *
 * `parseUploadRequest` bounds ONE REQUEST (`file.size > maxSizeBytes`). A chunked
 * transfer is N requests, and `joinChunkedUpload` validated only
 * `total_chunks <= MAX_CHUNKS` and never summed a byte — so 100 000 parts each
 * under the per-request cap assembled, unrefused, into a file arbitrarily past
 * the ceiling the catalog advertises and `get_system_info` publishes. The limit
 * the engine stated was not the limit the engine enforced.
 *
 * This gate pins the three counting doors and the retention law:
 *
 *   • AT RECEIPT — the running total per transfer refuses the chunk that would
 *     cross the ceiling, BEFORE that part is written (receipt is where disk
 *     exhaustion actually happens; the join only runs once every byte is
 *     already on the disk).
 *   • AT THE JOIN, BEFORE ANY OUTPUT EXISTS — the pre-check sums the parts on
 *     disk and refuses without opening `assembled`.
 *   • DURING ASSEMBLY — the authoritative running total refuses a part that grew
 *     under a concurrent chunk POST after the pre-check read it.
 *   • AND A SIZE REFUSAL IS A QUARANTINE, NEVER A DELETE: the parts stay, the
 *     `rejected.json` marker names the reason, `listQuarantinedUploads` reports
 *     it, and a retry reads 'already rejected' instead of 'missing chunks'.
 *
 * Plus the prose leg: the catalog's own DEDALO_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES doc may not
 * promise a whole-file ceiling without naming the summation that makes it true —
 * the stated/enforced mismatch is the defect from either side. A planted
 * offender (the pre-fix paragraph) proves the checker bites.
 *
 * Situation-built, no DB, no install fixture: real parts written through the real
 * receiver into a MARKED scratch media root (test/helpers/media_scratch_root.ts).
 * The ceiling is driven through the `maxSizeBytes` FUNCTION ARGUMENT — never a
 * wire field — so the refusal is exercised without writing gigabytes; the last
 * test proves the DEFAULT is still the configured value and not a test-sized one.
