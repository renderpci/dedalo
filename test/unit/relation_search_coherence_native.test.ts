/**
 * THE ANCESTOR INDEX MOVES WITH THE LOCATORS (P1-7 / DATA-12).
 *
 * `relation_search` holds, per component, the ANCESTOR chain of every locator
 * the component points at. Since 2026-08-09 it is READ, not write-only:
 * `conform.ts` emits `direct OR ancestor` for positive operators and
 * `NOT direct AND NOT ancestor` for the negating set. So a door that rewrites
 * `relation` and leaves `relation_search` standing makes the two stores
 * disagree PERMANENTLY, and search answers wrongly in BOTH directions — the
 * removed term still matches a broader-term search, and the negating operators
 * still exclude the record.
 *
 * `maintainRelationSearchIndex` had exactly ONE production caller (the component
 * save). The two doors that also REMOVE relation locators — `deletePortalLocator`
 * (portal delete-locator, text_area tag-delete, MCP `dedalo_portal_unlink`) and
 * `removeAllInverseReferences` (every holder of a record being deleted) — wrote
 * `relation` and never touched the index. PHP called `$component->Save()` on
 * both, so this was an unledgered divergence, not parity, and the only self-heal
 * was an unrelated later save.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, after each door: `relation_search[tipo]` may hold no ancestor
 * of a locator absent from `relation[tipo]`.
 *
 * (!) FIXTURE DISCIPLINE. This gate creates its OWN hierarchy term under an
 * existing branch and removes only that. An earlier draft deleted a term of the
 * SHARED synthetic hierarchy to trigger the inverse sweep and left the fixture
 * two rows short (1298 of 1300) for every later gate — the exact
 * consume-a-shared-fixture failure the suite's own law forbids.
