/**
 * CATALOG-BEHAVIOUR TRIPWIRE — the catalog's PROSE against the ENGINE (DEC-12).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. `config_docs_tripwire` proves the three generated artifacts
 * (install/sample.env, docs/config/config.md, docs/config/config_db.md) are
 * byte-for-byte what `src/config/catalog/` renders — the catalog and the manual
 * cannot drift. NOTHING proved the catalog matches the CODE. So a sentence could
 * describe an engine behaviour that no function performs, and every gate stayed
 * green while the manual lied.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THAT PROVES IT (audit P0-13, closed 2026-08-30).
 * `DEDALO_BACKUP_TIME_RANGE` documented, for the whole life of the TS engine:
 * "Dédalo check in every user login if the last backup exceed this time lapse,
 * in affirmative case, it will create new one." That is v6 behaviour, inherited
 * as prose and never as code — the login path starts no backup, and nothing else
 * does either. An operator who trusted that sentence believed they had periodic
 * backups and had NONE. For a museum with one copy of its records, that single
 * false sentence is a total-loss risk, and it was invisible to every gate in the
 * tree. The prose is corrected (see the `// (!)` note at the entry in
 * src/config/catalog/ops.ts); this gate is what keeps a claim like it honest.
 *
 * THE RULE. A catalog key whose prose describes an engine BEHAVIOUR must name the
 * function that performs it, and that function must have a PRODUCTION CALLER.
 *
 * WHERE THE FUNCTION IS NAMED, AND WHY HERE. Not in the `doc` field: that string
 * is rendered straight into the operator's manual, which carries no `src/` paths
 * by precedent. The mapping therefore lives in this file, as an ENUMERATED census
 * with a reason per row — which is also the honest shape, because "this prose
 * describes a behaviour" is a JUDGEMENT that cannot be derived reliably from
 * English. See the LIMITS block at the bottom for exactly what that costs.
 *
 * Two legs:
 *   A. every listed key still exists, names a function that is DEFINED where the
 *      row says, and that function is REACHED from production code;
 *   B. a DERIVED trigger over all operator-facing prose: a key that promises an
 *      automatic/periodic action must be on the list in A or on a shrink-only
 *      waiver list with a reason. This is what catches a key added tomorrow —
 *      for the one class of claim that can be recognised mechanically.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-30: 267 operator-facing keys, 9 of them match the leg-B
 * pattern, 8 listed as claims + 1 waived.

/**
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT PROVE — stated plainly, because implying more coverage
 * than exists is the same class of defect it was written to close.
 *
 *  1. It does not prove the function does what the sentence SAYS. It proves the
 *     named code exists and is reachable from production. `backupFreshness` could
 *     be rewritten to always return "fresh" and this file would stay green — the
 *     behaviour itself is gated by its own tests, not here.
 *  2. Leg A is a JUDGEMENT, enumerated by hand. A key added tomorrow whose prose
 *     claims a behaviour outside the leg-B pattern is NOT caught until somebody
 *     adds a row. There is no way around that: "this English describes an engine
 *     action" is not derivable, and a pattern loose enough to catch everything
 *     would fire on the 267-key catalog wholesale — a gate nobody could keep.
 *  3. Leg B recognises ONE class of claim (an automatic/periodic action). Prose
 *     that says "the server rejects X" or "the value is applied to Y" is not
 *     matched.
 *  4. "Reached from production" is a static, comment-stripped identifier match,
 *     not a call graph. A reference inside dead-but-shipped code counts as a
 *     caller; a call assembled dynamically from a string does not.
 *  5. Nothing here reads the generated artifacts — that is config_docs_tripwire's
 *     job, and the two gates are deliberately disjoint: one holds the DOCS to the
 *     catalog, this one holds the CATALOG to the code.
