/**
 * ONE OUTBOUND GUARD, AND NO NEW DOOR BESIDE IT (P1-26 / CARRY-10 / CARRY-14).
 *
 * `src/core/security/ssrf_guard.ts` is the hardened primitive: it RESOLVES the
 * hostname and vets every address, and bounds both the wait and the read. What
 * it does with a redirect depends on the door (engineering/OUTBOUND_SPEC.md):
 * the single-call door (`fetchGuardedText`) REFUSES one, because a 3xx
 * re-chooses the target; the pinned hop (`fetchPinnedHop`) RETURNS it unread,
 * so the harvesting door (`src/core/harvest/`) can put the new target through
 * the whole policy again before a socket opens to it.
 *
 * WHO MAY HOLD WHICH DOOR is censused here too, by IMPORT GRAPH: the pinned hop
 * has exactly one production importer (the harvest redirect loop), that loop
 * (`followVetted`) exactly two (`harvestFetch` and the robots.txt fetch), and a tool
 * reaches a raw door only by a written, reasoned exemption — a tool harvests
 * through `harvestFetch`. Before this census both rules were prose.
 *
 * Two doors carried private four-string blocklists — `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
 * `::1`, `169.254.169.254`, plus a private-range regex — and the transcriber's
 * file SAID it was a copy of the translator's ("duplicated here rather than
 * widening another module's surface"). Both missed `127.0.0.2`, `0.0.0.0`,
 * decimal-integer IPv4, `anything.localhost`, every DNS NAME that resolves
 * inward, and the redirect hop; their `::1` arm was DEAD CODE, because
 * `new URL('http://[::1]/').hostname` is `[::1]` WITH the brackets.
 *
 * A SOCKET, NOT A SPELLING — the lesson `external_outbound_tripwire` already
 * learned, relearned here the hard way. THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS FILE pinned the
 * three literal spellings the deleted guards used, and an adversarial review
 * put the whole blocklist back with the variable renamed `host` → `h` and the
 * regex alternation reordered: 11 pass, 0 fail. That gate forbade one
 * historical spelling of the defect, not the defect. What a new outbound door
 * CANNOT avoid is opening a socket, so that is what is counted.
 *
 * SHRINK-ONLY, NOT A CLEAN BILL. The exempt list below is the burn-down CARRY-14
 * names, frozen: these sites predate the guard and most still lack its timeout,
 * byte ceiling and redirect refusal. Freezing them says "no NEW door", not "these
 * are fine". An entry may only be REMOVED.

//   - `fetchPinnedHop` returns a redirect unread and vets only the ADDRESS. Every
//     other rule a new target must pass again (scheme, https → http, the host

//     caller is a second redirect loop, and the first one that forgets a rule is
//     an open redirect into an institution's harvester.
//   - A tool reading another site's pages owes robots.txt and a polite pace,
//     which only `harvestFetch` pays. A tool on a raw door skips both silently —
//     and so does one on `followVetted`, whose per-hop robots/pacing check is
//     whatever its caller passes, so it is censused as a door of its own.
//
// A binding is followed, not a spelling: named, renamed, namespace, default,
// `export … from`, `export *`, a top-level `const x = door` re-exported, a
// literal `import()` / `require()` — through any number of re-exporting
// modules. What it deliberately does NOT follow is a WRAPPER (`function get(u)
// { return fetchGuardedText(u) }`): a wrapper is a new function with its own
// contract, reviewed where it is written, and `harvestFetch` is exactly such a
// wrapper around the pinned hop.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ATTACKER-AAAA TRUTH TABLE (SURF-2, 2026-09-30)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
 * Every way an IPv6 address can CARRY an IPv4 — standardized (mapped, NAT64 /96),
 * local-use NAT64 in every RFC 6052 layout, the deprecated IPv4-compatible and SIIT
 * forms, the 6to4 and Teredo tunnels, a DISCOVERED network-specific prefix and a
 * DECLARED one at every layout — crossed with non-public and public payloads, plus the
 * special blocks, a first-hextet allowlist sweep and multi-record answers. Each row is
 * the AAAA an attacker's own DNS server hands out for `attacker.test`, and it is driven
 * through EVERY consumer of the address policy:
 *
 *   1. assertPublicUrl('http://attacker.test/', {lookup}) — refused `private_resolved`,
 *      or passes returning exactly the row;
 *   2. assertPublicUrl on the literal `http://[row]/` — `private_literal`, or passes;
 *   3. isPrivateIp(row) — the synchronous verdict, equal to 2;
 *   4. isSafeLocalAsrUrl('http://[row]/') — the on-premise transcriber's policy. With
 *      the private-host exemption ON it refuses iff the row reaches a cloud metadata
 *      address through ANY carrier (or is one, or is a tunnel) and ALLOWS loopback and
 *      RFC 1918 payloads (so the exemption is not over-blocked); OFF it equals 2.
 *   5. claimedIpv4s(row) — the guard's ONE answer to "which IPv4 may this reach", which
 *      the transcriber already reads for every form of its host (consumer 4 judges each
 *      claim; its own redundant copy of the deprecated/local-use tables is PENDING
 *      deletion): it must hold every IPv4 the oracle says the row's carrier may deliver
 *      (tighten-only superset) — and, under an authoritative carrier, no spurious
 *      layout reading, or consumer 4 with the exemption OFF refuses what 2 accepts.
 *
 * THE ORACLE IS THE TEST'S OWN: an RFC 6052 §2.2 encoder/decoder, a byte parser, the
 * metadata set and the tunnel blocks are written here, never read from the guard — a
 * table derived from the code under test agrees with any bug in it.
 *
 * A REGRESSION LOCK, not a red-first reproduction: at the sha this block was written
 * the guard's verdict path already matched it (the allowlist landed 2026-09-29), and
 * the one open class — the transcriber judging carriers with tables of its own — is
 * behaviour-equal until one copy drifts. Its teeth are the mutations recorded below
 * (SURF-2 closure plan §D), each of which must turn this block red.
 *
 * MUTATIONS — run 2026-09-30 against src/core/security/ssrf_guard.ts, each applied
 * alone, each RED (this file + guarded_text_pin_native + outbound_fetch_tripwire):
 *   M1  TUNNEL_IPV6 = []                     6to4 public rows pass 1-3; tunnel metadata allowed (4 on)
 *   M1b drop '2001::/32' only                Teredo rows allowed by the transcriber (4 on)
 *   M2  drop '64:ff9b::/96'                  NAT64 public control refused
 *   M3  drop '::ffff:0:0/96'                 mapped public control refused
 *   M4  no 2000::/3 check (a blocklist)      sweep, fec0::1, 100::1, compat rows pass
 *   M5  carried isNonPublicIpv4 deleted      mapped / NAT64 / declared non-public rows pass
 *   M6  drop 2001:db8::/32 | 3fff::/20 | 2001::/23, one at a time — its row passes
 *   M7  discovered prefix authoritative      hostile-mode public rows pass (3, 4 off)
 *   M8  discoveredNat64 → []                 discovered non-public rows pass (1, 2)
 *   M9  no unbracket                         literal rows answer dns_failed
 *   M10 vet addresses.slice(0, 1)            multi-record rows pass
 *   M11 declaredNat64 → no prefixes          declared non-public rows pass
 *   M12 deprecated embeddings not claimed    compat/SIIT rows: claimedIpv4s misses the payload (5)
 *   M13 LOCAL_USE_LAYOUTS = [96]             local-use /48-/64 rows: claimedIpv4s misses it (5)
 *   M14 fetchGuardedText = assertPublicUrl + fetchBoundedText — pin gate red (rebinding case)
 *   M15 fetchGuardedText follows the Location — the pin gate's 3xx case red
 *   M16 possibleIpv4s also read under an authoritative carrier — declared local-use
 *       rows: the transcriber (4, exemption OFF) refuses the public payload the guard
 *       accepts, and claimedIpv4s is not the declared reading (5)
 * M12/M13 bite through consumer 5 while the transcriber still carries its own copy of
 * those tables; once it reads only `claimedIpv4s` they bite through consumer 4 too.

 * …). So EVERY address byte primitive of ip_address.ts (and the guard's block packer)
 * is censused by binding, and outside `src/core/security/` a holder needs a row saying
 * which way it judges:

 *     it must equal the guard. Registering a new outbound module is what puts it under
 *     the table — the verdict is measured, not the spelling.
 *   - `inbound` — it judges a CLIENT's address against an operator allowlist (no
 *     destination, no carrier question); its reason says so.
 *
 * Rows may only SHRINK (a row whose module holds no primitive is red). The census's
