/**
 * MOCK ISOLATION — `bun test` shares ONE process, so a module mock and a global
 * stub are not scoped to the file that installs them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-21). Two files were quietly corrupting
 * every other file in the tier, and neither of the victims mocked anything:
 *
 *   - `client_upload_queue_render` replaced `globalThis.URL` with a plain
 *     object carrying `createObjectURL`/`revokeObjectURL`. A plain object is
 *     NOT a constructor, so every `new URL(...)` elsewhere in the process threw
 *     "Object is not a constructor". The visible symptom was
 *     `external_transport_native` reporting `bad_config` where it asserts
 *     `blocked_host` — a SECURITY gate naming the wrong reason for a refusal,
 *     in a file that touches no globals at all.
 *   - `client_tm_list_destroy_race` mocked `events.js` with only the one export
 *     it uses. `mock.module` is process-global, so the module was TRUNCATED for
 *     everyone: another file importing it died at import with "Export named
 *     'dd_request_idle_callback' not found", nowhere near the cause.
 *
 * Both were invisible in isolation and only appeared in certain file ORDERS,
 * which is the worst property a gate can have: the suite's own signal stops
 * being trustworthy, and a real regression can hide in the noise.
 *
 * ── THE TWO RULES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. A `mock.module` factory returning an object literal must not NARROW the
 *     module's export surface: it either spreads the real module (`...real`) or
 *     covers every one of its exports — or carries a named exemption.
 *  2. A file that installs a module mock must restore it (`mock.restore()`), or
 *     say why it does not need to.
 *
 * ── HOW RULE 1 IS MEASURED (rebuilt 2026-08-22) ───────────────────────────────
 * The scan used to match `mock.module\([^,]+,` — a module-id group that CANNOT
 * contain a comma, so every `mock.module(join(DIR, 'a', 'b'), …)` site was
 * INVISIBLE (10 of them, the whole client-module family). Both css.js
 * truncations lived in that blind spot and were reported as engine failures in
 * unrelated files. The site scanner now brace-walks the argument list instead of
 * regexing it, RESOLVES the module id (evaluating `join()` over string literals,
 * `import.meta.dir` and file-local consts) and compares the factory's top-level
 * keys against the REAL module's exports. That is strictly stronger than
 * "must contain `...`": a single-export module (ui.js exports only `ui`) is
 * whole without a spread, and a 5-export module stubbed with 1 key is caught
 * whether or not it spreads something else.
 *
 * ── HONEST LIMITATIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - It reads SOURCE, not behaviour: a factory that spreads the wrong module
 *    passes. The rules make the common accident impossible, not every accident.
 *  - A module id it cannot resolve statically, or one that names no file on
 *    disk (a VIRTUAL id), has no surface to compare — those fall back to the
 *    spread rule and are listed in the baseline with that reason.
 *  - GLOBAL STUBS ARE NOW COVERED (2026-08-24) — this limitation is retired.
 *    Three rules below scan every `globalThis.X =`, `(globalThis as T).X =` and
 *    alias form (`const globals = globalThis as …`), which is how the corpus is
 *    actually written. What they still CANNOT see, stated plainly:
 *      · a PARTIAL restore — `tool_transcription.test.ts` restores three of the
 *        six globals it assigns, and a file-level rule cannot tell that from a
 *        complete one. Per-key detection is not textually possible: the
 *        compliant files restore in a LOOP over a saved map, so demanding a
 *        per-key restore statement would redden correct teardown.
 *      · a computed-key write (`globals[name] = …`) or a write inside an
 *        imported helper. Neither shape exists in the tree today.
 *      · a stub of a global that is NOT a runtime constructor here (Bun has no
 *        DOM, so `Node`/`Option`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`DocumentFragment` are
 *        undefined and assigning them defines a shim rather than destroying a
 *        builtin) — those are allowed deliberately, not overlooked.
 *
 * ── SCOPE (widened 2026-08-25) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The scan used to read `test/unit/` ONLY (`UNIT_DIR = import.meta.dir`), while
 * `bun test` runs test/unit, test/parity AND test/integration in the SAME
 * process — a mock installed by a parity or integration file was invisible to
 * this gate by construction. The scan now walks `test/**` for `*.test.ts`
 * (fixtures carry no `.test.ts` files, and the gate excludes itself), and file
 * identity is the path RELATIVE TO `test/` (`unit/foo.test.ts`), so two tiers
 * can never collide on a basename. Measured at the widening: the 82 files
 * outside test/unit install NO module mock and assign NO global — the only
 * occurrence of `mock.module(` outside unit/ is PROSE in
 * `integration/publication_api_v2_smoke.test.ts`'s header (it describes a mock
 * in the publication app's OWN suite, a separate Bun process), which is why the
 * restore rule now CONVICTS on comment-stripped source: a gate must not
 * baseline a file for MENTIONING the thing it bans. (Its acquittal side stays
 * raw — see `installsWithoutRestore` for the measured reason.)
 *
 * HERMETIC: filesystem reads of tracked test source. No DB, no network, no clock.

 * RULE 4 — A GATE THAT SUBSTITUTES A CLIENT MODULE RUNS IN ITS OWN PROCESS
 * (2026-10-02, test/helpers/isolated_gate.ts).
 *
 * The client modules under test bind their leaves ONCE per process, and both
 * substitution mechanisms are process-global (a module mock is never reverted,
 * a plugin is never unregistered — and Bun's on-disk transpiler cache even
 * carried a plugin's redirects into LATER processes). Eighteen client gates
 * re-masked ui.js / events.js in turn and each measured the stubs of whichever
 * ran before it: ~30 reds in the CI image's readdir order, none in the Mac's.
 * So a test file that substitutes a module of the client tree (`client/`,
 * `tools/`) — a `mock.module` of such a path, or any in-process `Bun.plugin` —
 * must be an isolated gate: it calls BOTH `isIsolatedGateChild(import.meta.path)`
 * and `mirrorIsolatedGate(import.meta.path)`. A plugin written inside a template
 * literal (a driver a test spawns as its OWN process) is not in-process and is
 * not counted.
