/**
 * TIER WIRING — every gate the repo owns is REACHED by a workflow that EXECUTES.
 *
 * P0-1 residual of the 2026-08-26 deep audit (GATE-02, GATE-03, GATE-14, GATE-15). The
 * three earlier P0-1 gates answer "does the tier script run its array"
 * (tier_execution), "does every test file have a tier" (tier_assignment) and "is every
 * tripwire assigned" (ci_workflow rule 3c). None of them asked the question underneath:
 * is the tier script itself RUN BY ANYTHING? Measured at HEAD before this gate:
 * scripts/ci/client_gate.sh (133 browser suites), `bun run test:update` and
 * `bun run test:update:dev` were invoked ONLY from .github/workflows-selfhosted/ — a
 * directory GitHub does not read on a public repo (ci_workflow rule 5) — and
 * scripts/verify.ts likewise. Wired, green, and never executed on any CI.
 *
 * WHAT IS HELD, each leg DERIVED from the tree with a floor, never a hand list:
 *
 *   A. TOTAL census of scripts/ci/*.sh: each is reached from an EXECUTING chain
 *      (.github/workflows/*.yml or .gitlab-ci.yml → `bash scripts/ci/x.sh`, transitively
 *      through `bash`/`source` lines of the scripts themselves) or sits in the
 *      shrink-only SELF_HOSTED_ONLY map with a reason. A stale row is red.
 *   B. Every `run:` payload of .github/workflows-selfhosted/*.yml — the parked tier — is
 *      DELIVERED by a hosted chain (its tier script reached; its `bun test` paths
 *      claimed by an executing TierSpec; verify.ts's stages twinned) or the workflow
 *      is exempt with a reason. The mirror's steps may not be the only home of anything.
 *   C. scripts/verify.ts's stage names, DERIVED from its `results.push({ name })` and
 *      `runTestFiles('…')` calls, each have a hosted twin that is actually executed.
 *   D. Every package.json `test:*` / `ci:*` script that names a `scripts/*.ts` module is
 *      invoked BY NAME from a reached script or executing workflow, or carries a reason
 *      in the shrink-only LOCAL_ONLY_SCRIPTS map.
 *   E. Every tier root (a script a workflow runs directly) keeps the independent-stage
 *      accumulator, and every job that BUILDS the suite database declares its own
 *      service container.
 *   F. Every job that runs a tier root carries NO step-level `if:`, NO
 *      `continue-on-error:`, and no job-level `if:` EXCEPT the one sanctioned dedupe
 *      condition — a conditioned job is silent on the events it excludes, a tolerated
 *      step is green whatever the tier said; `needs:` no job that is itself
 *      conditioned (a skipped upstream skips the tier, transitively); the step's WHOLE
 *      payload is exactly `bash <root>` — `|| true`, `; true`, a `run: |` block around
 *      it and a `| tee` (no pipefail in the default shell) all swallow the verdict; and
 *      no tier root exits before its accumulator decides. Measured: `if: false` on the
 *      instance job, `continue-on-error: true` and `|| true` on its run step, and a
 *      `needs:` on an `if:`-gated job each left the other legs green.
 *      THE DEDUPE CARVE-OUT (2026-09-26): one sha landing on both LANDING_BRANCHES ran
 *      every tier twice, so a job-level `if:` reading `needs.<job>.outputs.<key>` /
 *      `needs.<job>.result` of an UNCONDITIONED upstream job is allowed — but it is not
 *      trusted by spelling. It is EVALUATED (skipConditionFaults) over every event ×
 *      upstream result × output: true on every non-push event (a PR, a dispatch, a
 *      schedule can never be skipped), true on a push whose upstream said nothing or
 *      `false` (fail-open), and true on a push whose upstream FAILED or was cancelled —
 *      the implicit success() is MODELLED, so a condition without the `!cancelled()`
 *      guard is red: a failed dedupe would skip the tier, and a skipped job passes a
 *      required check. Its grammar is closed — an optional `!cancelled() && ( … )`
 *      around `||`-joined `==`/`!=` comparisons against a quoted literal — so
 *      `always()`, `success()`, a bare `&&`, a negation or a function call is red, not
 *      guessed at. What the upstream probe decides is ci_workflow_tripwire rule 19's
 *      business: it is executed there against stubbed run listings.
 *   G. Every executing workflow that runs a tier root FIRES on the events work lands
 *      through: `pull_request` bare (no paths/branches/types narrowing) and `push` to
 *      exactly LANDING_BRANCHES (`master`, `v7`; held equal both ways so neither the
 *      constant nor the files can drift alone). The GitLab mirror's tier job carries no
 *      `allow_failure`, no `when: manual|never`, rules for merge requests AND the
 *      default branch, and the run line as its whole script item. Measured: every
 *      workflow back to `branches: [master]` — the audit's exact GATE-03(c) — left
 *      legs A–F green; so did `on: workflow_dispatch` alone.
 *   H. Every STAGE line (`bun …`, `bunx …`, `bash scripts/ci/…`) of every reached
 *      script carries its exit status to the verdict: bare under `set -e`, or
 *      `|| x_rc=$?` + `[ "$x_rc" -eq 0 ] || … tier_status=1`, or a `|| {` block that
 *      raises, or under `set +e` a `V=$?` capture that reaches `exit "$V"`. `|| true`,
 *      `; true`, `|| echo`, a pipe, an `_rc` nobody checks: red. No exemption exists:
 *      the ADVISORY_STAGES row that excused the unit tier was deleted with its raise
 *      restored (2026-10-02). Measured: `bun run test:update || true` in
 *      instance_tier.sh left legs A–F green (leg D credits the invocation, leg E only
 *      asks that tier_status is raised SOMEWHERE).
 *   I. Every `scripts/ci/*.ts` — the directory holds programs; a library belongs in
 *      scripts/lib/ (derived from the directory, never from an `import.meta.main` spelling) — is
 *      invoked BY NAME from a reached script or executing workflow, or carries a reason
 *      in the shrink-only LOCAL_ONLY_CI_MODULES map (ceiling 0, reason > 60 characters,
 *      both asserted); leg H then holds that the line
 *      carries its verdict. Measured 2026-09-30 (PUB-05): deleting db_tier.sh's whole
 *      MariaDB-tier stage (`bun run scripts/ci/mariadb_tier.ts`) left legs A–H,
 *      ci_workflow, tier_execution, tier_assignment and test_timeout all green — a
 *      stage module is not a package.json script, so leg D never saw it.
 *   J. Every tier root that STARTS the suite MariaDB (an explicit start, the MariaDB
 *      stage, or a `bun test` / TierSpec module over a file that acquires it — derived
 *      from mariadb_tier's own set) STOPS it on exit. EXECUTED, not read: the real root
 *      runs with `bun`/`bunx`/`git`/`apt-get`/`mkdir` stubbed to record-and-do-nothing;
 *      its run must end with `suite_mariadb.ts stop`, and a second run SIGTERMed at its
 *      first start must still reach the stop. Measured (C6/C7): deleting the EXIT-trap
 *      stop left every other gate green; a later `trap … EXIT` replaces it silently.
 *   K. In every tier root that runs the MariaDB stage (`bun run scripts/ci/mariadb_tier.ts`)
 *      the stage runs LAST: in the same executed, stubbed run as leg J, the only command
 *      recorded after it is the EXIT trap's `suite_mariadb.ts stop`. Its re-runs (8 set
 *      files, a ~170-file armed no-contact batch) write to the suite Postgres, so a stage
 *      ahead of the unit or parity baseline check moves the database those baselines were
 *      recorded on — the parity verdict could move with no code change. Measured (H1,
 *      round 4): the stage block moved before the DB-backed tripwires left tier_wiring,
 *      tier_execution, tier_assignment, ci_workflow and test_timeout all green.
 *   L. Every red-baseline CHECK a tier root runs (`bun run scripts/<unit|parity>_baseline.ts
 *      --check`) FAILS that root: in the same executed, stubbed run as legs J/K, the check
 *      made to exit 1 turns the root's exit non-zero — and every other recorded command
 *      still runs (the independent-stage accumulator, not an abort). Leg H reads the raise
 *      line; this leg measures the OUTCOME, so a raise spelled into a variable nobody
 *      reads, or an `exit 0` after it, is red too. Mutation (2026-10-02): commenting out
 *      db_tier.sh's unit raise reds this leg.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT GATED, and said so rather than pretended: GitHub branch protection is
 * owner-only and unobservable from the repo. The required checks (`ci / hermetic`,
 * `db / db`, `db / instance`) and the periodic `gh api …/branches/<b>/protection`
 * verification are a runbook step in engineering/CI.md, not an assertion here. Nor is
 * GitLab's default branch observable (its rules are held textually), nor a `shell:`
 * override on a step (a single command's status is the step's under any shell).
 *
 * DB-free by construction: file scans plus the import of the two TierSpec modules
 * (the same import tier_assignment_tripwire makes on the hermetic tier).

// A path "claimed by an executing TierSpec" was, until this law, DELIVERED by name alone.
// A file under it whose every case SKIPS runs nothing wherever it is delivered, and the
// claim hid that: the MariaDB integration gates skipped green on every runner without
// the installation's socket while the leg reported the parked `bun test` payload as
// delivered. So a claimed file is delivered only when its FROZEN per-file floor (the
// claiming spec's baseline `per_file`, bun's own JUnit counts) shows it ran something.
//
// NO TWIN EXCUSES A VACUOUS FILE (review 2026-09-30). The first form let an
// engineering/twin_map.json twin that ran something ADMIT its all-skipped target. But the
// map DERIVES a twin's status from the target: `retired` (the target is gone — it is in no
// claimed path), `frozen-record` (the target survives WITH frozen reds — so it runs), and
// `supplement` (the target survives with no red — which an all-skipped target always
// does). So the only twin that could ever admit was a `supplement`, whose own rule says it
// ADDS coverage and does not replace the target: one `@twin-of` header on any running test
// excused a new all-skipped file with no reason and no ceiling. The admission was a

// A MariaDB gate's first acquisition cold-installs and starts a DETACHED mariadbd (the

// trap. A later `trap … EXIT` REPLACES that trap in bash, silently, and a trap set after
// the first start leaves the window before it unguarded. Measured (mutations C6, C7):
// deleting either EXIT-trap stop left every gate green. So the leg EXECUTES each tier
// root — the real script, with `bun`, `bunx`, `git`, `apt-get` and `mkdir` replaced by a
// stub on PATH that records its argv and cwd and does nothing — and judges the OUTCOME:
//   1. the stubbed run completes (exit 0), so every stage line was walked;
//   2. a root whose run STARTS the suite server (an invocation that starts it, or runs a
//      test file that acquires it — derived from mariadb_tier's own set) must END with
//      `bun run scripts/ci/suite_mariadb.ts stop`: an EXIT trap that a later one replaced
//      ends with something else;
//   3. the same root, SIGTERMed at its FIRST starting invocation, must still run the stop
//      (bash runs the EXIT trap on SIGTERM): a trap set after that line never fires.
// NOT CLOSED HERE, said so: a module that spawns `bun test` over acquirers WITHOUT
// declaring a TierSpec (or naming mariadb_tier / suite_mariadb start) is not classified
// as a starter; SIGKILL runs no trap at all (nothing in bash can).

 * The dedupe carve-out's judge: the faults of a tier job's job-level `if:` expression,

 * optional `!cancelled() && ( … )` status guard around `||`-joined comparisons
 * `<operand> ==|!= '<literal>'`, the operand `github.event_name`,
 * `needs.<a job this one needs>.outputs.<key>` or `needs.<a job this one needs>.result`
 * — and anything outside it is a fault (`always()`, `success()`, a bare `&&`, `!x`, a
 * function call), because a condition this gate cannot evaluate is one it cannot vouch
 * for. String comparison is case-insensitive, as GitHub's is.
 *
 * The status guard is MODELLED, not assumed: without it GitHub applies the implicit
 * `success()`, so a FAILED (or timed-out) upstream SKIPS the tier — and a skipped job
 * reports as passing to a required check, so a runner fault in the dedupe would pass
 * branch protection with no tier executed. That is a fault here. `!cancelled()` lets
 * the tier run whatever the upstream's result; only a cancelled WORKFLOW stops it.
 *
 * Required outcomes, over every upstream result (success, failure, cancelled) and
 * output ('true', 'false', ''): TRUE on every non-push event — a pull request, a
 * dispatch or a schedule can never be skipped; TRUE on a push whose upstream did not
 * conclude success (the probe proved nothing); TRUE on a push whose output is empty or
 * `false` (the probe failed open or found nothing). The ONE admissible skip is a push
 * whose upstream concluded success and said 'true'.
