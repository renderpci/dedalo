/**
 * PROXY TRUST: A HEADER IS ONLY AS TRUSTWORTHY AS ITS TRANSPORT (P2-4, 2026-08-24).
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is a request header — anything that can open a connection can write
 * it. It is believable only because a reverse proxy is known to have rewritten it, which
 * makes "is a proxy in front of THIS listener?" part of the answer, not a deployment
 * detail.
 *
 * The hop arithmetic was already right (`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` from the right, never the
 * left-most entry). What was missing is that it ran on EVERY listener. On the direct TCP
 * listener — the one a browser reaches with no web server in front — a client sent its
 * own `X-Forwarded-For` and simply chose the value. Three consequences, all real:
 *
 *  - the login throttle is keyed on that address, so an attacker minted a fresh
 *    brute-force bucket per request — the exact evasion the hop arithmetic exists for;
 *  - `dd544` activity rows recorded an attacker-chosen address as fact;
 *  - the install gate matches the literal `127.0.0.1`, so a forged header was a claim to
 *    be loopback. The old comment on the function read "this is never an authorization
 *    input"; that was not true.
 *
 * There was a second, quieter bug in the same expression: `Math.max(0, len - hops)`
 * clamped a SHORT header to index 0 and returned its LEFT-MOST entry — the attacker's
 * own value — whenever fewer entries arrived than the operator declared hops.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this proves the resolution rule and its throttle consequence. It does
 * not prove that Bun reports the peer address correctly, nor that an operator's declared
 * transport matches their deployment — a `TRUSTED_PROXY_TRANSPORT=tcp` on a port with no
 * proxy is back to trusting the caller, which is why the default is `socket` and the
 * catalog says so.
