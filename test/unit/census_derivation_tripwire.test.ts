/**
 * CENSUS-DERIVATION TRIPWIRE (P2-20 / S-3) — a gate that censuses the tree
 * DERIVES its corpus, FLOORS the walk's own result, and takes its ROOTS from a
 * registered shared lister.
 *
 * THE DEFECT CLASS. The 2026-08-26 audit found five gates (GATE-30, -31, -34,
 * -35, -37) whose index row promised a total census while the gate iterated a
 * hand array (GATE-37) or walked a HARD-CODED SUBSET ROOT (the other four:
 * `client/dedalo` without `tools/*\/js`, `tools/` without `src/`, `src/`
 * without `tools/`, `test/unit` non-recursively). A new file, widget or key was
 * outside the census the moment it was written and the gate stayed green. The
 * per-gate fixes landed (dab019eb30); this file is the META-RULE those fixes
 * were instances of, so the class cannot be re-introduced one gate at a time.
 *
 * THE CENSUS IS THE INDEX, TOTAL. Every line of `engineering/TRIPWIRES.md`
 * that names a `test/...` gate is a row — with or without a closing `|` (the
 * first version required one and silently dropped three rows, two of them
 * offenders: the parsed count is asserted EQUAL to the count of gate-naming
 * lines). Each row is classified from its gate's SOURCE (comments stripped) —
 * never from the row's wording, so a gate cannot opt out by not shouting a
 * word. Three shapes:
 *
 *  1. WALKING GATE — a tree/registry derivation in CODE (`readdirSync`,
 *     `Glob`, `scanSync` — matched with every string, template and regex
 *     literal BLANKED, so a control template or a hand-array member that SAYS
 *     `readdirSync` is text), or one that lives in a string judged on the
 *     literal itself (`'ls-files'` as a process argument, `from
 *     '../fixtures/….json'`), in the gate or in a module it imports from the
 *     shared test infrastructure (`test/helpers/`, `scripts/`, `publication/`
 *     — never the engine under test). It must carry a BOUND FLOOR: a
 *     `toBeGreaterThan(<n ≥ 0>)` / `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(<n ≥ 1>)` — an int
 *     or a SCREAMING const resolved to its value, so `>= 0` (or `>= ZERO`
 *     with `const ZERO = 0`), which an EMPTY walk satisfies, is no floor — (or
 *     an exact literal set) whose `expect(...)` argument names something BOUND
 *     TO THE WALK, and that EXECUTES: an unconditional statement of a live
 *     `test`/`describe` body (not `test.skip`/`.todo`, not behind
 *     `if (n > 0)`, not per-element inside a loop over the walk, not in a
 *     helper that may never be called, not inside a string). Binding is
 *     resolved BY POSITION over DECLARATIONS — `const`/`let`, `function`,
 *     every parameter (which shadows), every loop variable (bound to what it
 *     iterates): a declaration is bound when its body holds a derivation or
 *     uses a bound name outside a literal and not as an object key, where a
 *     call of a bound function counts only if no argument is a SYNTHETIC
 *     INPUT (an unbound object/Map/Set/string literal, or an array of FILE
 *     paths — a hand-written corpus a control feeds to the real helper); a
 *     name a bound block mutates is bound. A floor on an unrelated value, on
 *     a control's result, or a parked floor is no floor. Walking gates that
 *     still lack one are the `FLOORLESS_WALK_BASELINE` (shrink-only, each
 *     entry self-tested to still be floorless — the debt cannot be paid
 *     silently, nor grow). The bracket tracker under all of this is
 *     self-tested to close EVERY registered gate at depth 0 (a regex it read
 *     as division once desynced seven gates' verdicts).
 *
 *  2. HAND-CORPUS GATE — no derivation anywhere, but an array literal of three
 *     or more repo paths: the GATE-37 shape. Allowed only as an ENUMERATED
 *     entry with its reason (a reasoned policy list is not a corpus).
 *
 *  3. Everything else makes no census and is left alone.
 *
 * A row that says TOTAL/TOTALITY in the index (the machine-read claim) is held
 * to shape 1 with the bound floor, or is one of at most five ENUMERATED
 * closed-set exemptions (a registry constant, one builder's emitted SQL, a type
 * union pinned by `Exclude<…>` to `never`, a scenario axis the gate builds) — a claim over a closed in-code set
 * has no tree to walk. Each exemption carries a `corpusToken` whose presence,
 * and whose row's claim, are self-tested.
 *
 * ROOTS ARE DECLARED, NOT CHOSEN IN-FILE — AND THE DECLARATION IS CHECKED
 * AGAINST THE ARGUMENT OF THE WALK. The subset-root defect is a root list that
 * lives inside one gate. The rule: a gate that CHOOSES a walk root — by its own
 * `readdirSync`/`Glob`/`git ls-files` call, or by the argument it hands a
 * parameterized shared lister — is in `PRIVATE_ROOT_WALKERS`, a shrink-only,
 * capped baseline whose every entry WRITES THE ROOTS ITS WALKS ARE FED, ONE
 * GROUP PER WALK SITE (`ROOTS: \`src\` \`tools\` ×3; \`test\``) plus the count of
 * sites this rule cannot read (`[opaque: n]`) — and the entry is held EQUAL to
 * what the evaluator below finds: not "is the root spelled somewhere in the
 * file" (an allowlist string or a fixture path spells `tools/` while the walk
 * no longer visits it) but what each derivation call is FED. The evaluator
 * reads the call's argument symbolically: string, template and brace literals;
 * `join`/`resolve`/`dirname`; `import.meta.dir`; a variable's initializer (by
 * position); a loop variable's iterated elements (array, object keys/entries,
 * destructured by index or key); a PARAMETER's arguments at every call site of
 * its function — in the gate or in a shared module, through the import that
 * names it — or the receiver a callback is mapped over; a function call's
 * returns; a `.scanSync` cwd combined with its Glob's pattern; `git ls-files`
 * pathspecs under `-C`/`cwd:`. A path is a root only when it normalizes to a
 * TRACKED repo directory (from the git index; a scratch tree resolves to
 * nothing); the repo root itself narrows nothing, so a gate that hands
 * `REPO_ROOT` to a lister chose no root, while one that hands `src/core` did.
 * A site whose argument is beyond the evaluator is OPAQUE — counted, never a
 * silent root — and so is a site fed through a NARROWING it cannot decide:
 * a predicate method over the root candidates (`.filter`/`.find`/`.slice(1)`;
 * `.sort()`/`.slice()` reorder or copy and narrow nothing), a conditional
 * expression (`flag ? SRC_ONLY : ALL`), or a root loop whose body leaves an
 * iteration before the walk (`if (prefix === 'tools/') continue`) or tests a
 * root-bound name — before the walk or in the loop over its results
 * (`if (prefix) continue` discards every tools file by its root). GATE-34's
 * outcome spelled as control flow instead of a dropped literal reads as
 * `[opaque: 1]`, a reviewer's eye, never as the over-approximated feed. The
 * sift a recursive walker applies to LISTING RESULTS (`continue` on
 * node_modules, then `walk(child)`) narrows names under the root, not the
 * root, and is not opaque; nor is a per-file exclusion whose condition also
 * names the result variable. A NEW walking gate imports a registered shared lister instead.
 * Every shared module a gate reaches under `test/helpers/` or `scripts/` that
 * walks or chooses is in `SHARED_LISTERS`, the ONE place the repo's corpus
 * root sets are written down: membership is DERIVED (reached-but-unregistered
 * or registered-but-gone is red), and each entry's root groups are held equal
 * to what the lister's sites are fed across every gate that reaches it (a
 * parameterized lister's group is the union of what its callers hand it; a
 * known subset is written next to the roots — `env_key_scan` walks `src/`
 * while `scripts/` reads keys too — so the gap lives where the roots are).
 * The write-path class (`sql_confinement`, `ws_a`, `matrix_counter_monotonic`,
 * the `section_record` chokepoint grep) shares `write_path_corpus.ts`, rooted
 * at `src/`+`tools/`+`scripts/` (positive control: a script that mass-rewrites
 * matrix jsonb), and owns no private walk.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT. Binding (for floors) and evaluation (for roots) are lexical
 * and scope-approximate: a name resolves to the last declaration of that
 * spelling before its use, a function body may resolve a module constant
 * forward, a call's arguments are joined as a cartesian product over every
 * call site. The evaluator cannot read a root computed by string surgery, a
 * method result or a runtime value — those sites are opaque and the entry must
 * say how many. Narrowing is detected by SHAPE, not evaluated: a predicate
 * whose result is a constant reads as opaque all the same; a short-circuit
 * guard (`prefix === '' && walk(root)`), or a sift of the walk's results whose
 * condition also names the result variable (`if (prefix && rel) continue`) or
 * goes through a boolean computed a statement earlier, read as the whole
 * feed. It cannot judge whether a subtree root (`src/external`) IS the
 * whole corpus of what a gate claims, nor whether a hand array beside a walk
 * is the corpus or a ratchet over it — those stay a reviewer's call, and the
 * written per-site groups make the choice reviewable in one place. Every
 * decision is a pure function over (row, gate source, module sources),
 * exercised below on synthetic positive and negative controls — the five
 * audit defects re-planted verbatim among them — so each leg is
 * mutation-verifiable.
 *
 * Hermetic: fs-only (plus one `git ls-files` for the tracked-directory set),
 * imports no src/ module.
