/**
 * TRIPWIRE — EVERY DOWNSTREAM OBLIGATION OF A RECORD WRITE FIRES FROM THE
 * CHOKEPOINT, NOT FROM WHICHEVER CALLER REMEMBERED (P1-8: DATA-15..19, DATA-28,
 * DATA-29; CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2: the obligation ledger — CORE-1, CORE-2, TOOLS-5).
 *
 * A component write incurs obligations the writer does not own: the save event,
 * the security reaction (dd128/dd234), the RAG index event, the modified stamps,
 * the 'NEW' activity row for a birth, the OBSERVER cascade (which needs the
 * BEFORE-image: a removed locator's mirror must drop the record) and the `_hi`
 * ancestor index (`relation_search`). Each used to be a call a door REMEMBERED,
 * and the doors that forgot are the findings: the time machine's whole-record
 * restores never propagated, the observer recompute wrote an `_hi` mirror with
 * no index, three media doors wrote files_info raw over an unlocked snapshot.
 *
 * The structural answer: the CHOKEPOINTS own every derived write.
 * `afterRecordWrite` (section_record/record_write.ts) is the one hook; it
 * enqueues the observed change on the OBLIGATION LEDGER
 * (section_record/obligation_ledger.ts), which drains post-commit; the
 * chokepoint writers derive `relation_search` in the same UPDATE; the one
 * files_info writer is reached only through the locked transform. This gate
 * holds that shape DERIVED from the import-resolved writer closure
 * (test/helpers/matrix_writer_closure.ts) — never from body substrings:
 *
 *   A. CENSUS — TOTAL over every raw `db/matrix_write.ts` DML caller in the
 *      write-path corpus: each must REACH `afterRecordWrite` through resolved
 *      references (any depth), or carry an ENUMERATED, shrink-only exemption —
 *      partitioned into chokepoints, PENDING units, the SANCTIONED derived
 *      writers (the ONE list tool_lossless shares — rows derived from it) and
 *      the enumerated non-derived writers.
 *   B. THE LEDGER, DERIVED —
 *      B1 every RECORD_WRITE_CHOKEPOINTS unit reaches afterRecordWrite;
 *      B2 afterRecordWrite reaches the save event, the security reaction, the
 *         RAG event and the ledger; the ledger reaches the observer cascade;
 *      B3 the chokepoint writers AND the two INSERT doors (create, duplicate)
 *         reach the relation_search derivation, and only record_write units
 *         MAY call it (every edge — a namespace escape counts);
 *      B4 EXCLUSIVITY, two-sided: the ONLY units that MAY call (every edge, a
 *         namespace escape included) the cascade, the recompute unit and
 *         kernel, the ledger's enqueue, the derivation's birth law, the
 *         removal-law, mirror and covered-slot entries, the per-key kernel
 *         (its flag-value hatches: only the four named entries reach it) and
 *         the files_info writer are the enumerated ones, and each enumerated caller PROVABLY
 *         still calls it — a door that remembers an obligation itself is red;
 *         and every afterRecordWrite caller outside the chokepoint is pinned to
 *         the outcome case holding what it declares;
 *      B5 positive controls: a synthetic corpus with each offence is reported
 *         by the same analysers;
 *      PENDING the raw tree-move and archive-restore writers the closure names
 *         are enumerated with the step that closes them; any change to one is
 *         red (a change detector, labelled as one).
 *   S. SPELLING CHECKS (labelled honestly: they read source text) — the NEW
 *      activity emitters, the door activity rows, the birth funnel, the
 *      component_info stored branch.
 *   C. TIMING — the three cache branches of `fireSaveEvent` ride
 *      `deferPostTransaction`.
 *   D. observers.ts TOTAL — every `catch` block increments a counter; the
 *      in-transaction rethrow lane is GONE (B6: propagation never runs inside a
 *      transaction, so there is nothing to rethrow into).
 *
 * The behavioural twins: write_obligations_native (every door's obligation
 * effects), obligation_ledger_native (the ledger's outcomes: restore/undelete
 * propagation, the `_hi` recompute index, post-commit drain, savepoints),
 * media_files_info_lost_update_native (the locked media transform).
