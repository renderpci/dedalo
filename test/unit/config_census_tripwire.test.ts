/**
 * CONFIG-CENSUS TRIPWIRE (DEC-12: every documented invariant has a mechanical gate).
 *
 * Three sets must agree, or the config story is a lie somewhere:
 *
 *   A. the env keys the engine ACTUALLY READS  (scanned from src/)
 *   B. the keys the v6→v7 migration knows about (`migration_map.ts`:
 *      the non-DROPPED targets of V6_MIGRATION, plus NEW_IN_V7)
 *   C. every constant a real v6 install can set  (the vendored fixture)
 *
 * A == B  ⇒ the migration can never promise a key the engine ignores, and a new
 *           key cannot be added to the engine without being classified (which is
 *           also the moment it gets documented).
 * C ⊆ map ⇒ no legacy constant is silently dropped on the floor: every one is
 *           classified, DROPPED entries carrying an explicit reason.
 *
 * The fixture is VENDORED (test/fixtures/v6_config/) rather than read from the
 * sibling v6 checkout: a gate that depends on a directory outside the repo is a
 * gate that passes vacuously in CI. It is a byte copy of v6's shipped
 * sample.config.php + siblings — i.e. exactly what `cp sample.config.php
 * config.php` gives a real install.
 *
 * NOTE `../private/sample.env` is the operator-facing census, but it lives
 * OUTSIDE the repo, so it cannot be gated here. `migration_map.ts` is therefore
 * the in-repo source of truth, and sample.env is documentation generated from the
 * same knowledge.
