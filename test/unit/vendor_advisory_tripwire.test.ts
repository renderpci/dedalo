/**
 * VENDOR ADVISORY TRIPWIRE (DEC-12) — a vendored third-party tree may not sit
 * inside a published advisory, and may not go unreviewed past its own window.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (CLI-26, S1, 2026-08-28). `vendor/pdfjs` was 5.7.284 —
 * inside GHSA-hq66-cqwq-w95j / CVE-2026-16633 (HIGH, "arbitrary JavaScript
 * execution upon opening a malicious PDF", `>= 5.6.83, < 6.2.108`, published
 * 2026-08-06) — for 22 days with every gate GREEN, in a viewer iframe that is
 * same-origin with the application under the operator's own session. Nothing in
 * the repo could see it:
 *   - `bun audit` reads lockfiles, and `vendor/` has none;
 *   - the vendor staleness axis was a documented NUDGE that "NUDGES, never
 *     fails" — it printed `pdfjs 5.7.284 — reviewed 2026-07-12 (46 days ago)`
 *     with the advisory 25 days inside that window, and exited 0;
 *   - `dependency_integrity_tripwire` says in its own header that it proves a
 *     digest EXISTS and matches, never that the bytes are benign.
 * Three green gates over an unpatched remote-code-execution surface. This file is
 * the axis none of them covered. The tree is now 6.2.108 (also the npm dist-tag
 * `latest`, so the advisory fix and the latest-stable law were one move) — but the
 * gate, not the bump, is the durable half: the bump ages, the question does not.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS. **Census: TOTAL** over `vendor/vendor_manifest.json` rows —
 * every vendored tree, no exemption list:
 *   1. every row declares an advisory coordinate (`ecosystem`+`package`+`version`,
 *      the identity a feed is keyed to) or STATES why no coordinate exists;
 *   2. the machine `advisory.version` and the human `version` have not drifted;
 *   3. the DECLARED VERSION IS THE VERSION THE BYTES SAY — `version_evidence` names
 *      a file inside the lib's own tree and a literal that must appear in it, and
 *      the literal must itself contain the declared version. Added by the CLI-26
 *      review, and it closes the same hole one level up: a row reading 6.2.108 over
 *      a 5.7.284 tree satisfied the digest (it hashes whatever is there), the range
 *      check and the feed query all at once, because all three read the LABEL.
 *      A tree that states no version anywhere (json-view) says so, in a reason a
 *      human wrote and this gate requires;
 *   4. `reviewed` is inside the row's own `review_window_days` — a HARD FAIL, which
 *      is the whole difference from the nudge it replaces;
 *   5. the declared version is not inside any ledgered advisory range, unless the
 *      row carries an acceptance with a closed-set reason code, an unexpired date
 *      and at least one `verify` clause that the checker RE-PROVES against the
 *      tree on this run.
 * Plus the mitigation that survives a revert of the bump, asserted on BOTH facts it
 * rests on and then EXECUTED rather than believed: the mount forces
 * `enableScripting:false` (the advisory's own stated workaround) and, before it,
 * `disablePreferences:true`. The second is not decoration — `enableScripting` is a
 * PREFERENCE-kind option, so `pdfjs.preferences` in localStorage is applied over it
 * by `AppOptions.setAll(prefs, true)` after the mount's handler returns. The gate
 * runs the vendored `AppOptions` implementation itself (the `web/app_options.js`
 * chunk of `vendor/pdfjs/web/viewer.mjs`, evaluated with a stub `navigator`) and
 * proves the whole chain on the real bytes: the default is ON, the mount's `set()`
 * turns it OFF, a preference write turns it BACK ON, and `disablePreferences` is
 * what makes `_checkDisablePreferences()` return true — the guard the viewer's
 * `Preferences` constructor consults before applying any of them.
 *
 * WHY OFFLINE. `bun test` must be credless and hermetic, so the ledger is
 * committed data and this gate never touches the network. The other half —
 * discovering an advisory nobody has ledgered yet — is in `scripts/ci/audit.ts`,
 * which asks the GitHub advisory feed the same question per coordinate. Its
 * three-way outcome (finding / rejected request / degraded lookup) is a POLICY, and
 * `classifyAdvisoryFeedStatus` is tested here on constructed statuses, because the
 * case that matters — an anonymous 403 rate limit rendering as a vulnerability, on a
 * shared runner IP — is not one a test can produce on demand.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS.
 *   - A vulnerability with no advisory entry, or one keyed to a package name a
 *     vendored bundle does not share, is invisible to BOTH halves. `vendor/json-view`
 *     carries no version string at all, so nothing can be keyed to it — its row says
 *     so, and its review window is then the only signal it has.
 *   - "Inside a range" is a version comparison, not an exploitability judgement. An
 *     acceptance is where exploitability is argued, and it must be argued in a form
 *     a machine re-checks (a plugin absent from the served bundle), never in prose
 *     alone.
 *   - `version_evidence` binds a LABEL to a LITERAL, not to provenance. It refuses a
 *     mislabelled tree; it cannot refuse a tree whose upstream build was tampered
 *     with before we fetched it. That is `archive_sha256`'s job, and only pdfjs and
 *     xlsx have one.
 *   - The executed `AppOptions` control proves the option machinery, not the browser:
 *     that the mount's handler runs before the viewer constructs is asserted
 *     structurally (no `await` before the `set()`), and was measured by hand in a
 *     real browser on 2026-08-28.
