/**
 * CSS CORPUS HONESTY tripwire (DEC-12; CSS coherence audit 2026-09, DESIGN.md
 * clause 2.0, findings C13 / C14).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Every other CSS gate in this repo is a claim ABOUT a corpus: `css_build`
 * compares committed bytes against a fresh compile of `entrypoints()`,
 * `css_token_duplication` asks who may declare a palette in entrypoint space,
 * `contrast_ratio` scores WCAG ratios over the built served sheets,
 * `theme_token_parity` reads two palette files. Not one of them asks whether the
 * corpus it walks IS the set of bytes a browser can fetch. That question had no
 * gate, and the answer was no:
 *
 *   - `page/css/layout/theme_dark.css`, `page/css/layout/functions.css` and
 *     `area_maintenance/widgets/dedalo_api_test_environment/css/…css` were
 *     tracked, served 200 by `serveClientAsset` (no extension allowlist), and
 *     were the compiled output of PARTIALS — files `main.less` / `area_maintenance.less`
 *     `@import`, therefore never in `entrypoints()`, therefore inside no gate's
 *     corpus. `theme_dark.css` was a 190-line 2026-07-11 snapshot of a palette
 *     that is 251 lines today: 13 token names carrying DIFFERENT values from the
 *     ones that ship, 50 tokens missing entirely. A stale palette, one URL away
 *     from the real one, that every gate was structurally unable to see. The
 *     third one does not even compile standalone (`.dd_console is undefined`).
 *     All three were deleted on 2026-09-05. This gate is what stops a fourth.
 *
 *   - `css_source_tripwire` (the gate this one extends) asks the same family of
 *     question over `tools/*​/css/*.css` — 37 of the 46 committed sheets. The nine
 *     it never saw are exactly where the three orphans lived.
 *
 * And in COMPILED space, a second hole with the same shape: the source walker in
 * `css_token_duplication_tripwire` (assertion 5) reads `.less` TEXT to decide who
 * declares a palette at a global root, and it was MEASURED to be defeated by a
 * single `}//x` line before the block (it strips only whole-line `//` comments,
 * then reads `buf.split(/[;}]/).pop()` as the selector — the trailer becomes part
 * of the "selector" and the block stops being a `:root`). A partial planted under
 * `main.less` can therefore re-declare `:root { --color_white: red }` and retune
 * the DEFAULT light axis document-wide with the whole suite green. Nine sibling
 * bypasses of the same walker were measured (`;//` trailer, `html:root`,
 * `:root:not(.x)`, `:where(:root)`, a detached ruleset, `@{sel}` interpolation…).
 * Patching the walker closes one of nine. Assertion 3 below does not read source
 * at all: it reads the COMPILED bytes, where none of those spellings survive.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS ASSERTS
 *
 * (1) SET EQUALITY, BOTH DIRECTIONS. The tracked `.css` under the build's own
 *     search dirs equals the built entrypoint outputs, UNION the third-party set
 *     DERIVED from `scripts/lib/third_party_census.ts` (the repo's one derivation
 *     of "this file is somebody else's code"), UNION a shrink-only, re-proved
 *     exemption list. Both sides are derived: `git ls-files` on one, `entrypoints()`
 *     on the other. No file list is written down here that a rename could empty.
 *
 * (2) SERVED-DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION. Every entrypoint declares WHICH DOCUMENT
 *     its bytes land in, with a reason. The 37 tool sheets are derived, not
 *     listed: `tool_common.js` composes their URL as
 *     `tool_base_url(model) + '/css/' + model + '.css'`, so the classification is
 *     the loader's own template checked against the tool registry
 *     (`tools/*​/register.json`) in both directions. The six that are not tools
 *     are declared one by one, and each declaration is RE-PROVED against the tree:
 *     a sheet classified as loaded must be named by some tracked JS/HTML, a sheet
 *     classified DEAD must be named by nothing.
 *
 * (3) ONE DECLARATION PER (TOKEN, ROOT SELECTOR), IN COMPILED SPACE. In the bytes
 *     the SPA document actually assembles — `main.css` plus every sheet
 *     classification (2) says is injected into that same document — each
 *     (at-rule context, global-root selector, custom-property name) triple is
 *     declared EXACTLY ONCE. A second declaration of the same name at the same
 *     root is, by the cascade, a silent retune of everything downstream of it:
 *     that is the payload the `}//x` hole lets through, and here it is a
 *     duplicate no matter how the source that produced it was spelled.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (the honest list)
 *
 *   - NOT that a committed `.css` is FRESH. Byte-equality against a fresh compile
 *     is `css_build_tripwire`'s job; this gate only proves a committed sheet is
 *     something the build produces at all.
 *   - NOT that a vendored sheet is current, safe or licensed. The third-party set
 *     is borrowed from the census; staleness and advisories are
 *     `vendor_advisory_tripwire` / `dependency_integrity_tripwire`.
 *   - NOT that a sheet classified DEAD is really unreachable. The re-prove is a
 *     lexical reference hunt over tracked JS/HTML — a URL composed at runtime
 *     from data (a `css.url` arriving in a tool context, an ontology-stored path)
 *     is invisible to it. It is kept because the injection CALL is the interface,
 *     and it is labelled a spelling here rather than dressed as an outcome.
 *   - NOT that the tool sheets are the tool sheets the SERVER serves. This reads
 *     the repo, not a running process; `client_serving.test.ts` is the leg that
 *     compares served bytes to disk bytes.
 *   - NOT that a token declared once is declared with a SENSIBLE value.
 *     Assertion 3 counts declarations; `contrast_ratio_tripwire` is the only gate
 *     that judges what a palette evaluates to.
 *   - NOT anything about a custom property declared on a NON-root selector, or on
 *     a root selector inside a standalone document (the PDF.js iframes, the
 *     client-test harness) — those are separate documents and a name colliding
 *     across them is not a cascade event.
 *   - NOT that `main.css` is the only sheet the SPA document carries. It is the
 *     only one the page loads at boot; the rest arrive through `load_style()`,
 *     and assertion 3's union is exactly the set (2) says arrive that way — no
 *     more.
 *
 * COST: `git ls-files` + reads of the tracked `.css` and of the tracked JS/HTML
 * under the shipped trees. No DB, no network, no clock → hermetic tier.
