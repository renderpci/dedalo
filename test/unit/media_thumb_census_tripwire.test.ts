/**
 * THE THUMB/POSTERFRAME CENSUS TRIPWIRE — the gate that keeps the five media
 * models CONSISTENT with each other.
 *
 * The consistency work of 2026-08-08 replaced five hand-maintained answers to
 * "where does this model's thumbnail come from, and who may write its source?"
 * with two declarations in concepts/media.ts (THUMB_SOURCE_BY_MODEL,
 * POSTERFRAME_WRITER_BY_MODEL) and one handler (media/thumb.ts). Declarations rot
 * the moment nothing reads them, and a per-model divergence is exactly the kind of
 * thing a future change reintroduces one branch at a time — this is the mechanical
 * check, per the house law that an invariant is tripwired or deleted.
 *
 * It asserts four things:
 *  1. THE CENSUS IS TOTAL AND CONSISTENT — every model classified, the derived
 *     sets in agreement, the operator remedy present exactly where the engine
 *     cannot mint.
 *  2. ONE GRAMMAR — the posterframe path/URL producers agree for every model and
 *     every path-option shape, including `additionalPathOverride`, which one of
 *     the three copies used to ignore outright.
 *  3. ONE WRITER — no module outside path.ts assembles a posterframe or thumb path
 *     from string fragments.
 *  4. ONE HANDLER — every trigger goes through thumb.ts rather than resolving a
 *     thumb source for itself.

// or a locator here, so no corpus and no DB round-trip were added.
