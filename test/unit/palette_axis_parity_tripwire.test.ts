/**
 * PALETTE-AXIS PARITY tripwire (DEC-12; CSS coherence audit 2026-09-05, DESIGN
 * clause 2.b, findings C2 / C3 / C11 / C15). Subsumes and replaces
 * `theme_token_parity.test.ts` (2026-07-30 → 2026-09-06).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. A custom property declared ONCE, with a light value, and
 * consumed as a SURFACE, while the ink over it follows the theme: in dark both
 * go near-white and the text disappears. Measured live before the fix:
 * `--tool_identify_soft` #eaf2f4 under the inherited #e5e7ea page ink = 1.09:1,
 * at nine rule sites in two tool sheets — the `.menu_mobile_wrapper` bug the
 * retired gate was written for, third sighting. That gate paired FOUR prefixes
 * across TWO files (`vars_tokens.less` ↔ `theme_dark.less`): a token whose light
 * half lives in `tools/` was never in its corpus, and 72 of the 76 tool-private
 * tokens were invisible to it. The pairing rule for tool sheets was a comment in
 * `theme_dark.less` that nothing read, and `tool_sitebuilder` (born 2026-08-31)
 * reproduced the defect on its first day.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ASSERTS — over the COMPILED, SERVED set: every entrypoint
 * `scripts/build_css.ts` derives, compiled in memory by the same `buildOne` the
 * build runs (so the corpus is exactly what ships, and a stale committed `.css`
 * cannot fake a pass). The root palette COMBINATIONS are DERIVED from the
 * attribute selectors present on the served roots (`data-theme` × `data-design`
 * × `data-accent` today — `base`, `redesign`, `redesign+pine`), never
 * enumerated, so a new axis is judged the day its first `:root[data-…]` ships.
 * The cascade is MODELLED, not asserted: for a given `<html>` attribute set the
 * winning declaration is the most specific applicable one, byte order breaking
 * ties — which is what makes the redesign tie (C3) visible: `:root[data-design]`
 * (0,2,0) is emitted AFTER `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (0,2,0), so a redesign
 * light literal without a redesign-dark twin WINS under redesign+dark, and this
 * gate reads that result instead of counting lines in a block. Five legs:
 *
 *   1. TWIN PRESENCE. For every colour-valued token and every combination C:
 *      flipping the theme must change WHICH DECLARATION supplies the value
 *      (a distinct dark winner), or the value must be `light-dark()`, or the
 *      value must be a `var()` chain whose referent is itself paired (so
 *      `--tool_cataloging: var(--color_orange_dedalo)` is paired by inheritance
 *      and `--selection_fg: var(--color_black)` needs no copy). A core token
 *      re-declared by a tool on a bare `:root` is NOT flagged: the core dark
 *      twin outranks it whatever the injection order. A tool-private token
 *      (a name the core palette never declares) with no dark value anywhere is.
 *      The remedy for a tool sheet is a twin BESIDE its own `:root` (its own
 *      `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, as tool_print / tool_identify do) or a line
 *      in `theme_dark.less` — never moving the token into the core palette,
 *      which `css_token_duplication_tripwire` forbids. Exempt: THEME_INVARIANT
 *      (reason each; an entry that gains a twin is red) and tokens with no
 *      consumer at all (leg 4 owns those — the honest defect is not "needs a
 *      twin"). A fully transparent value needs no twin: it paints nothing.
 *   2. DARK-ONLY ORPHAN. A token with a dark winner and NO light winner under
 *      the same combination: light computes it to nothing and every consuming
 *      rule drops or paints its fallback (`tool_assistant` paints three
 *      different greens from scattered fallbacks). Carried from the retired
 *      gate, with the vendor register (`--ck-color-*`: CKEditor's own bundle
 *      declares the light half) verified against the vendor file.
 *   3. RESOLVED DIVERGENCE. Every token whose RESOLVED value differs between
 *      base light and base dark must ALSO resolve differently under every other
 *      combination's light and dark. This is the cascade RESULT, not a line's
 *      presence: a redesign light literal that beats theme_dark by source order
 *      resolves identically in both themes and is red here even when leg 1 is
 *      satisfied by a base twin; a copied twin INSIDE the design line is red
 *      here too (a copy is not a dark value).
 *   4. DECLARED-BUT-UNCONSUMED. A colour token declared on a global root with
 *      zero `var()` consumers in the served CSS and no reader in served JS
 *      (`ui.css_var`, dd-modal's shadow sheet) is red — and a token declared
 *      for light whose every consumer is scoped under the dark root is red as
 *      LIGHT-DEAD (the light theme has a token nobody reads, so its light
 *      surface is painted by something else — `--debug_info_bar_bg`, C10).
 *   5. PRECONDITIONS the model needs: no name is declared at the same
 *      combination by two served sheets with different values (the winner
 *      would depend on `load_style()` injection order, which no static reading
 *      can know), and no colour token sits on a root INSIDE a conditional
 *      at-rule (an OS-keyed `prefers-color-scheme` palette is outside the
 *      attribute axis the client sets and this gate judges).
 *
 * DAY-ONE STATE (2026-09-06) is BANKED, shrink-only, set-equal: the tool_assistant
 * dark-only block (14 orphans, leg 2), nine dead tokens (leg 4) and eleven
 * light-dead tokens (leg 4) are live defects in files this change does not own;
 * each is listed with its file and the fix, and an entry that stops failing is
 * red as stale — a bank that is not lowered hides progress and lets it regress.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS drive the same `analyse()` over synthetic sheets: a planted
 * light-only hex is red; a planted COPIED twin is GREEN here — that pair
 * documents the division of labour with the contrast gate (2.c), which is the
 * only instrument that reads a value's legibility.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE. That a twin is LEGIBLE (a dark value chosen badly passes legs
 * 1–3; `contrast_ratio_tripwire` judges the pairs); anything about dimension,
 * duration, shadow or url tokens (they are not colour-valued and are skipped);
 * scoped overrides (`.wrapper_tool.tool_x { --x: … }` is the sanctioned idiom
 * and bounded by its selector — outside the root corpus by design); which FILE
 * carries a twin; a consumer that reaches a token through a name built at
 * runtime (`var(--${x})` in JS) — the JS scan is a substring read; and the
 * cross-element cascade (a `body { --x }` beside a `:root { --x }` is modelled
 * by element depth, not by the DOM). The two PDF.js sheets render into their
 * own document, so a twin in `theme_dark.less` cannot reach them: they are held
 * to an in-sheet twin, and today declare no root token at all — that leg is
 * honestly vacuous until one does.
 *
 * COST: compiles the 43 entrypoints (~1s), reads 775 served JS files and two
 * vendor files. DB-less, network-less → hermetic tier.
