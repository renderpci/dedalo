/**
 * Phase 8 gate: the TS RAG seam — index → hybrid retrieve → ACL.
 *
 * Runs fully OFFLINE on the deterministic hash embedder (no API keys, no
 * sidecar): two real records are BUILT in the disposable test section, indexed
 * through the PRODUCTION indexer, then retrieved with the hybrid (dense +
 * lexical, RRF) search. The ACL gate is the DoD assertion: a user the human API
 * denies gets NOTHING from the same query. Everything created is removed after.
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS THIS FILE CARRIED UNTIL 2026-08-30 (audit 2026-08-26, P1-14).
 *
 * 1. IT INDEXED THROUGH A DOOR PRODUCTION DOES NOT HAVE. `indexComponentText`
 *    lived in retrieval.ts with NO production caller — its only importers were
 *    this file and its two siblings — and it carried its own unchecked
 *    `embed()` cast. A gate that drives a test-only door proves nothing about
 *    the path a curator's save actually takes, and it kept that door (and its
 *    bug) alive in production source. The door is deleted; every index below
 *    now goes through `RagIndexer` — the same class `buildRagIndexer()` wires
 *    for the drain and the save queue — over the REAL `resolveEmbedDocs`
 *    resolution seam, so descriptor → ddo_map → chunk → embed → upsert →
 *    stale-prune is exercised end to end.
 *
 * 2. IT CLAIMED "OFFLINE" AND READ THE MACHINE. The docblock said deterministic
 *    embedder; the code called `getEmbeddingProvider()`, which resolves the
 *    provider from config. This developer's `../private/.env` sets
 *    `DEDALO_RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=sidecar`, so on a machine whose sidecar is
 *    not running every `embed()` returned `[]` (its documented fail-closed
 *    answer) and the gate wrote NULL embeddings until Postgres refused with an
 *    opaque not-null violation. That is the "tests BUILD the situation they
 *    test" rule broken: the provider is now PINNED, both halves (see below).
 *
 * THE SITUATION IS BUILT, NEVER FOUND: the records are reserved-high scratch
 * twins written through the real save path (`saveComponentData`), and the
 * `rag.embed` descriptor that opts the section in is declared HERE, in the
 * injected ontology port. Nothing is read from whatever the ambient DB holds.
 */
// Migrated to the generic `test` TLD 2026-08-20 (AGENTS.md hard rule). That
// migration WAS a rename of opaque identifiers; since the 2026-08-30 port to
// `RagIndexer` (audit 2026-08-26, P1-14) it is not, because the gate now
// MATERIALISES a matrix row (`createScratchRecord` + `saveComponentData`) and
// resolves it back through the production `resolveEmbedDocs` seam. What the two
// tipos below must satisfy — MEASURED by mutating this file on 2026-08-30, not
// reasoned from the names:
//   • `SECTION_TIPO` must be a real `model: section`. Point it at the
//     section_group `test45`, or at a tipo that does not exist, and the fixture
//     save refuses: `fixture save failed for <tipo>/<id>`.
//   • `TEXT_COMPONENT` must be a component tipo the write path accepts for that
//     section; an unknown one refuses identically. Its MODEL is NOT pinned
//     here — `test17` (component_text_area) and `test22` (component_number)
//     both go green — because the embed group's `ddo_map` is declared by THIS
//     FILE's injected ontology port, not read from `test2`'s own
//     request_config (which happens to list `test52` as well).
// So neither rename is silent, but neither is free. And emptiness is caught on
// its own: aim the descriptor at a tipo nothing resolves for and the retrieval
// assertions go red on an empty store rather than passing on nothing.
//
// One ontological oddity, since the names suggest otherwise: `test52` is NOT a
// child of `test2`. Its ONLY defining node in
// `src/core/test_data/test_tld_ontology.json` is
// `{tipo: test52, parent: test45, model: component_input_text}`, and `test45`
// is the `components a-z` section_group of the OTHER test section, `test3`
// (every other `test52` occurrence in that file is a REFERENCE, not a second
// definition — mostly ddo_map and `relations`, plus a few property spellings:
// test118's section_list_thesaurus_indexation, test137's section_map term, and
// test212's component_info widget source). The pairing holds because the descriptor names the component
// explicitly with `section_tipo: 'self'` — it is a reuse, not a parentage.

/**
 * THE PROVIDER PIN, HALF TWO — the INDEX half, which does have a seam, so it
 * gets the provider by INJECTION rather than by environment.
 *
 * This is the PRODUCTION `RagIndexer` class wired by hand. What it SHARES with
 * `buildRagIndexer()` (indexer.ts) is the load-bearing half: the real
 * `defaultRagStore()` and the real `resolveEmbedDocs` seam, so descriptor →
 * ddo_map → chunk → embed → upsert → stale-prune runs here exactly as it does
 * for the drain and the save queue.
 *
 * SIX constructor deps differ in value from `buildRagIndexer()` — `config`,
 * `ontology`, `provider`, `langs`, `nolan`, `recordTitle` — and the gate also
 * omits production's `...buildImageDeps()` entirely, since nothing here indexes
 * an image. The list below is what matters; treat it as the enumeration, not the
 * arithmetic. (An earlier revision said FIVE and folded `config` into `ontology`
 * in the same breath, which is exactly how an unlisted difference becomes an
 * untested one.)
 *  • `ontology` (and the `config` built over it) — the descriptor-bearing port
 *    above, so `test2` is opted in without mutating `dd_ontology`.
 *  • `provider` — the injected `DeterministicHashProvider` of this docblock.
 *  • `langs` — `[DOC_LANG]` rather than `config.menu.projectsDefaultLangs`:
 *    the fixture writes exactly one language, and inheriting the machine's
 *    list is the ambient-situation reading this suite forbids.
 *  • `nolan` — the literal `lg-nolan` rather than `readString('DATA_NOLAN')`,
 *    for that same reason.
 *  • `recordTitle` — deliberately EMPTY rather than `getTermByTipo`: the
 *    chunker prepends it to every chunk's embed text, so a shared title
 *    injects the same tokens into every record's vector — and the
 *    deterministic embedder is a bag of words, so that is exactly the noise
 *    that would blunt the vocabulary discrimination this gate measures.
 *
 * And one production dep is OMITTED: `buildRagIndexer()` spreads
 * `...(buildImageDeps() ?? {})`. This gate indexes text only, so it carries no
 * image half at all — the same shape an install with media indexing off gets.
