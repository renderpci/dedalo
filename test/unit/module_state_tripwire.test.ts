/**
 * Static tripwire for the §4 request-isolation invariant: NO request-carrying
 * mutable state at module scope in a long-lived Bun process.
 *
 * This is the enforcement the invariant lacked (biome only bans `var`; the rule
 * otherwise lived in prose). It is a TRIPWIRE, not a full purity proof: it flags
 * every module-level `let`/`var` against a small allowlist of known
 * request-INDEPENDENT lazy-init/boot caches, so a NEW top-level mutable binding
 * fails the build and forces a decision — either it is request-independent
 * (add it to the allowlist with a one-line justification) or it must be made
 * request-scoped (an AsyncLocalStorage scope, or a cache keyed by full identity
 * incl. user/lang). It also forbids capturing a request-scoped accessor into a
 * module-level binding (the classic bleed shortcut) AND capturing
 * config.menu.applicationLang/dataLang into a module-level binding (the S2-11
 * defect class: freezes the install default where PHP uses the per-request
 * lang). That last rule is WIDENED at the bottom of this file into a full
 * per-file CENSUS of every config.menu lang read outside src/config/, in any
 * position — the 2026-08-26 audit found the write doors reading it from
 * function-local ternaries, which the module-binding regex cannot see (P0-7).
 *
 * CACHE-FACTORY GATE (WS-B, DEC-13 rule 1): a module-level MUTABLE
 * `const … = new Map()/new Set()` cache must be created through
 * ontology/cache_factory.ts (createOntologyCache / createDataCache), which
 * hub/event-registers it BY CONSTRUCTION — the audit showed "modules remember
 * to register" fails in practice (S1-09: ≥16 of ~20 unregistered). Justified
 * non-factory module Maps/Sets live in ALLOWLISTED_MODULE_MAPSET, each entry
 * with a LIFECYCLE justification (who clears it, and when — DEC-12
 * refinement). Declarations typed ReadonlyMap/ReadonlySet are exempt (frozen
 * dispatch/constant tables, not caches). Key correctness (every identity the
 * value depends on is in the key) remains proven behaviorally by
 * concurrency_interleave.test.ts, not statically.
 *
 * MUTATED-CONST GATE (evasion-hole hardening, 2026-07-07): a module-level
 * `const NAME = {…}` / `const NAME: T[] = […]` is just as mutable as a `let` —
 * the audit proved the `let`-only scan blind to it (process_health.ts
 * poisonState, server.ts dbHealth shipped through it). The scan flags a
 * column-0 const OBJECT/ARRAY literal only when the SAME FILE later mutates it
 * (property/index assignment, ++/--, push/pop/shift/unshift/splice/fill/
 * copyWithin, set/add/delete, `delete NAME.x`) — so the many legitimate frozen
 * constant tables stay exempt with zero annotation burden (an unmutated const
 * literal is constant in practice; `as const`/Object.freeze shapes can never
 * be mutated so they never trip). Known request-INDEPENDENT process state
 * lives in ALLOWLISTED_MODULE_CONST with the same justification bar as the
 * `let` list. Module-level `new WeakMap()`/`new WeakSet()` joins the Map/Set
 * factory gate unconditionally (a module WeakMap is always a cache).
 * Residual (accepted) blind spot: mutation via an aliased reference or from
 * ANOTHER file (`import { x } …; x.y = 1`) — cross-file mutation of an
 * imported binding's properties is rare and reviewable.

/**
 * THE WIDENED LANG-READ CENSUS (P0-7, audit DATA-01) — `config.menu.dataLang` /
 * `config.menu.applicationLang` ANYWHERE outside `src/config/`, not only in a
 * module-level binding.
 *
 * WHY THE OLDER RULE ABOVE WAS NOT ENOUGH. It matches one shape,
 * `^const NAME = config.menu.dataLang`, and every site the 2026-08-26 audit
 * found was a FUNCTION-LOCAL ternary — `translatable ? config.menu.dataLang :
 * 'lg-nolan'` inside an import loop — which is structurally invisible to it.
 * Three bulk import doors resolved their WRITE language that way. The write is
 * lang-sliced, so the process-wide install default REPLACED the operator's
 * actual working language on every imported row and an empty cell CLEARED it,
 * with `ok:true` returned. The defect class is not "a module binding"; it is
 * "the static install default standing in for the per-request language".
 *
 * SO THE RULE IS A CENSUS, not a ban: the install default has legitimate
 * readers (the ALS accessors that fall back to it, the dispatch seed that
 * builds the scope, a login page that has no session yet, install-wide index
 * builders, report labels). Each is enumerated below WITH ITS REASON and its
 * measured count, and the ratchet is SHRINK-ONLY — a file may lose reads, never
 * gain them, and a file absent from the census may have none at all.
 *
 * Entries marked OPEN are not endorsements: they are the same defect class,
 * outside the edit scope of the change that installed this census, and they are
 * what a later pass has to remove.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: the scan is textual and skips whole-line comments (`//`, `*`,
 * `/*`) so prose naming the anti-pattern does not count; a read sharing a line
 * with a trailing comment still does. It cannot see an aliased read
 * (`const {menu} = config; menu.dataLang`) — no such site exists today, and the
 * census going stale is what would surface one.
