/**
 * TM HISTORY VISIBILITY TRIPWIRE (WC-2026-09-27-bulk-revert-undo-log §2.4) —
 * the census sibling of tm_epoch_tripwire, for the OTHER narrowing every
 * history reader owes since migration 0010: `tm_role IS NULL`.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT. A bulk run's undo log lives in `matrix_time_machine` beside
 * ordinary history: hidden BEFORE images (tm_role 1), birth markers (3), cascade
 * snapshots (4). Only the bulk revert may read them. Every other statement that
 * reads the table must be narrowed with `withTmHistory(…)` (epoch AND visible)
 * or `tmVisiblePredicate(…)`, or be EXEMPT here with the reason it must see
 * every row. tm_history_visibility_native MEASURES the outcome on the real
 * doors (list, count, filters, deep page, preview, apply_value, a probe); this
 * census is what makes a NEW reader — which nothing about writing one makes its
 * author think of — red the day it lands.
 *
 * WHY A CENSUS AND NOT A SPELLING PIN. The per-file pins count STATEMENTS, as a
 * pair (reads, narrowings) — a new statement moves `reads` without moving the
 * narrowing count. And the helpers themselves are measured by their OUTPUT
 * (the SQL fragment they return), not by their name: a `withTmHistory` that
 * stopped emitting `tm_role IS NULL` is red here, whatever it is called.
 *
 * SHRINK-ONLY: the exemption set may only shrink (its size is frozen below);
 * each exemption covers a COUNTED set of reads, so a second read added to an
 * exempt file does not inherit the first one's reason. Corpus: the write-path
 * corpus (test/helpers/write_path_corpus.ts — src/, tools/, scripts/), the
 * shared lister census_derivation_tripwire registers; scripts included
 * because an operator script (detect_csv_import_damage) reports history to a
 * human.
