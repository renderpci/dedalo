/**
 * KILL INTEGRITY — the BEHAVIOURAL twin of invariant 7 of
 * `test/unit/media_writer_discipline_tripwire.test.ts` (audit 2026-08 B2).
 *
 * That gate is a SOURCE SCAN: it proves every media declaration that runs an
 * external binary asks whether the process was killed. It cannot prove what the
 * answer then IS, and the answer is the whole defect. This file drives the kill
 * through the spawn seam and asserts the OBSERVABLE behaviour.
 *
 * THE CASE, precisely. `identify` prints its report incrementally, one line per
 * scene. A 3-scene layered TIFF cut after line 1 by a SIGKILL leaves stdout
 * holding a report that parses perfectly — as a SINGLE-SCENE source. That is not
 * a smaller answer, it is a WRONG one: "this file is one image" is exactly the
 * answer that makes every recipe skip scene selection, so the derivative ladder
 * is built from a truncated view of a master. The same shape appears on the two
 * other probes (`srgb  4.1` cut to `srgb  4.` parses to "no meta channel, NO
 * ALPHA" — the confident opposite of the documented `unknown`) and on the writer
 * (`runMagickTo`'s existence + scene post-condition both PASS on the partial file
 * a killed magick leaves behind).
 *
 * WHY `.timedOut` WAS NOT ENOUGH, which is the whole 2026-08-09 correction:
 * `spawn.ts` defines `timedOut = capExpired && signal !== null`, a STRICT SUBSET
 * of the kills. The first test below pins that discriminator on a real process —
 * a self-SIGKILLing child reports `signal !== null`, `timedOut === false`,
 * `ok === false` — so every case here is a kill the old `if (result.timedOut)`
 * branch was blind to: the OOM killer on a gigapixel decode (measured at 14.4 GB
 * RSS in `probe.ts`), a crashed delegate, an operator's `kill -9`.
 *
 * EVERY CASE CARRIES A POLARITY CONTROL WITH BYTE-IDENTICAL STDOUT. The fake
 * binary prints the same truncated report in both halves of a pair and differs
 * ONLY in whether it then kills itself. Without that control this file would
 * pass just as well against an engine that had merely become strict about short
 * reports — and being strict about short reports would be a NEW refusal the
 * oracle never made. The rule under test is "a killed command did not succeed",
 * nothing wider.
 *
 * HOW: `config.media.binaries.magick` is mocked to one tiny sh script that serves
 * both roles (`magick identify …` and `magick <convert argv>`), exactly as the
 * real v7 binary does. No real ImageMagick is needed, so this gate is green on a
 * host with none, and nothing here spawns a long-running process — the kill is
 * immediate and self-inflicted.
 *
 * OWN FILE ON PURPOSE: `mock.module` is process-global in bun and `mock.restore()`
 * does NOT revert it; the real config module is re-installed in `afterAll`.

 *
 * It dispatches on `$1 = identify` the way `magick` itself does, and inside the
 * identify role on the `-format` string, so all three probes in
 * `engine/probe.ts` are served by the same script:
 *
 *   `%s|%w|…|%m`               → probeImageSource  (the per-scene report)
 *   `%[channels]`              → probeMetaChannels (the layout + `<total>.<meta>`)
 *   `%[fx:standard_deviation]` → probeContentSpread (one number)
 *
 * Each prints a HEAD, then optionally kills itself, then optionally prints the
 * TAIL. HEAD alone is the truncated report; HEAD+TAIL is the complete one. The
 * kill/no-kill pair with the tail suppressed is what makes the polarity control
 * byte-identical.
