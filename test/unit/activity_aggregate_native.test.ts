/**
 * ACTIVITY AGGREGATE — the read model behind the job tray (2026-08-12).
 *
 * The defect this guards is one of OMISSION, which no UI test would catch: a
 * tray fed from `mediaJobs` alone renders a video transcode perfectly while
 * silently dropping a running publication — the longest process in the system —
 * and an empty tray reads as "nothing is happening".
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion here is the DIFFUSION STATE MAPPING TOTALITY. The
 * `state` CHECK constraint lives in src/diffusion/jobs/schema.ts and the mapping
 * lives in src/core/api/activity.ts; they are edited in different files by
 * different hands. A state present in the constraint but missing from the map
 * would land as `undefined` in the row and render a FAILED publication as
 * running — the exact "it looks like it is still working" lie this change
 * exists to remove.

/**
 * THE USER IDS ARE PART OF THE FIXTURE, NOT DECORATION.
 *
 * `collectActivity` reads TWO sources for the media half, and only one of them
 * is the scratch directory this file builds: `mediaJobs.jobsForUser` unions the
 * pfile mirror with the IN-PROCESS `mediaJobs` registry, which is a module-level
 * singleton shared by every test file in the same bun process. Repointing
 * DEDALO_MEDIA_PROCESSES_DIR isolates the mirror; it cannot isolate the
 * registry.
 *
 * A REAL HAZARD, AND NOT THE ONE THAT WAS MEASURED — both halves stated, because an
 * earlier revision of this comment claimed the second as fact and was wrong.
 *
 * THE HAZARD (why the ids below changed): this file used the id 4242, which is also
 * `OWNER` in test/unit/job_stream.test.ts. `collectActivity` unions the pfile directory
 * with the in-process media-job registry, so a completed job submitted for the same
 * owner elsewhere carries `finishedAtWall = Date.now()` (core/media/jobs.ts), lands
 * inside the five-minute recency window, and answers here as a `done` row no pfile in
 * this file ever wrote. A shared magic id across two files is a collision waiting for
 * the run order that exposes it.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE 2026-08-29 FLAP (adversarial review, same day): bun
 * runs a scanned directory in SORTED order, and both real invocations are sorted — the
 * census spawns `bun test test/unit test/integration` (a directory scan) and the shard
 * runner sorts its bins (scripts/test_shard.ts). `activity_aggregate_native` sorts
 * BEFORE `job_stream`, and before every other file that touches the registry, so
 * job_stream cannot have polluted this one in any run that actually happens. The
 * reproduction that appeared to show it had been given a manufactured order.
 *
 * The measured flap was a foreign uncaught exception: a `setTimeout` leaked by
 * test/unit/client_request_coalescing_tripwire.test.ts fired ~3 s after that file's
 * `afterAll` removed the `window` global it closes over, and bun attributes an uncaught
 * exception to whichever test is running at that instant. That is fixed at its source,
 * in that file. The id change here stands on its own merits: it removes a real
 * collision rather than a diagnosed one.
 *
 * These ids are therefore EXCLUSIVE to this file (censused across test/ + src/
 * the same day: 4242xx was in use up to 424264, nothing in the 42427x band), one per
 * case so the two cases cannot leak into each other either. Anything registered
 * under another id is invisible to the filter, which is what makes the rows
 * below exactly the rows this test built.
