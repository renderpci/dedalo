/**
 * DOCS CURRENT-ENGINE tripwire (DEC-12: every documented invariant has one).
 *
 * NOTE THE FILE NAME. This gate forbids a string, so it may not be NAMED with that
 * string — or the style guide could not cite its own enforcer without failing it. (It
 * was born as `docs_php_purge_tripwire.test.ts` and promptly flunked itself.)
 *
 * `docs/` is the PRODUCT MANUAL — the thing a new project reads to install and operate
 * Dédalo. The PHP engine is retired dead code, so the manual's law is:
 *
 *   PHP may appear ONLY as the thing you are migrating FROM (what changed, how to
 *   upgrade) or as HISTORY. It may NEVER appear as documentation of how the current
 *   system works.
 *
 * Before the 2026-07-12 sweep, 194 of 234 pages violated that: `docs/install/index.md`
 * was still a PHP install guide (and was the FIRST link in the "System administrator —
 * install" reading path, so a new project literally installed PHP by following the
 * docs), and `docs/core/**` explained TS by comparing it to PHP classes the reader has
 * never heard of. Prose rots back the moment nobody is watching, hence this gate.
 *
 * FOUR ASSERTIONS:
 *   1. no `php` anywhere in docs/, outside the reason-stamped allowlist
 *   2. no `rewrite/` path token — rewrite/ is GITIGNORED, so every such link is dead on
 *      a clone (and AGENTS.md forbids anything reading a path under it)
 *   3. every internal link resolves to a real file INSIDE docs/ — the in-repo mirror of
 *      `mkdocs build --strict`, which fails on links escaping docs_dir. Failing here
 *      costs 200 ms instead of a Python CI job, and stops the `../../engineering/X.md`
 *      trap at the door (engineering/ deliberately KEEPS its PHP references, so a link
 *      from the manual into it would re-import PHP through the back door).
 *   4. the allowlist is EXACTLY the files below — set equality, so nobody can quietly
 *      add a fifth entry instead of doing the work.
 *
 * WHY A RAW SUBSTRING, NOT `\bphp\b`: no English word contains the letters p-h-p, so the
 * raw substring is false-positive-free — while the word-boundary form would sail past
 * `phpMyAdmin`, `php-fpm` and `index.php5`.
