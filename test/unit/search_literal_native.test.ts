/**
 * A SEARCH IS LITERAL — measured on the corpus, through the whole search path
 * (DATA-34).
 *
 * `search_pattern_escape_tripwire` proves every `~*` operand is escaped. This
 * gate proves the CONSEQUENCE on real rows: a curator searching `[sic]` gets
 * the one record whose title carries `[sic]`, not the three-letter character
 * class Postgres used to compile that into.
 *
 * FIXTURE: the zzscale museum-scale corpus, whose string distribution exists
 * for exactly this question — `Denarius` / `Denarius [sic]` plus ONE value per
 * regex metacharacter (`Sestertius<char>mark`), so the census below is TOTAL
 * over the metacharacter class the engine declares, derived from the class
 * itself and never hand-listed. Built and torn down here; the corpus's own
 * contract gate (zzscale_corpus_native) owns its shape.
 *
 * The `~` in `Sestertius~mark` is NOT a metacharacter and is deliberately
 * absent from the class — a value carrying it is the corpus's own positive
 * control, planted in zzscale_corpus_native.
 *
 * THE SECOND ALPHABET (2026-09-05). The class above is the one a curator TYPES.
 * It is not the class Postgres COMPILES: every operand is normalized with
 * `f_unaccent`, and that dictionary EXPANDS characters INTO metacharacters
 * (`×`→`*`, `©`→`(C)`, `…`→`...`, `∖`→`\`, `⁅`→`[`, `¿`→`?` — 143 characters
 * in the shipped rules, measured here against the LIVE dictionary). An escape
 * applied before normalization neutralises metacharacters that do not exist
 * yet, which is why the escape now runs in SQL on the far side of f_unaccent —
 * and why the census below is derived from the database's own dictionary and
 * not from any list in the repo.
