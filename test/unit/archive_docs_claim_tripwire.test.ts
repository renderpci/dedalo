/**
 * ARCHIVE DOCS CLAIM tripwire — the manual may not promise a round trip the CSV
 * door cannot deliver, and must point the operator at the door that can
 * (audit 2026-08-26 P1-10; DATA-10, DATA-11, DATA-13 — filed "because the
 * manual already makes the claim").
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `docs/tools/using_export.md` told a curator that the
 * Dédalo (Raw) CSV is "a re-importable backup", moves data "between
 * installations" and imports back "byte-for-byte"; the CSV import re-conforms
 * every cell as typed input (text_area markup rewritten, geolocation item ids
 * dropped, empty cells clearing values, locators checked for shape only, no
 * media bytes). The engine's lossless door is the archive (`src/core/archive/`,
 * `engineering/ARCHIVE_FORMAT.md`), proven by raw_roundtrip_native. The core
 * pages were corrected first and the user guides — the two-tier rule: a user
 * guide moves with its core page — were not; nothing mechanical noticed. This
 * gate is what notices.
 *
 * THREE LEGS:
 *   1. NO CSV ROUND-TRIP PROMISE anywhere in docs/: the formulations the manual
 *      used (each listed with its reason), scanned line by line over the WHOLE
 *      tree with a corpus floor and a planted positive control per phrase.
 *   2. THE TRUE DOOR IS NAMED where the raw format is sold as a backup: every
 *      page that names `dedalo_raw` and speaks of a backup links to the archive
 *      door anchor of the core export page, and that anchor exists there.
 *   3. THE FORMAT DOC MATCHES THE CODE: `engineering/ARCHIVE_FORMAT.md`'s
 *      "Not archived" list carries exactly the entries `NOT_ARCHIVED` in
 *      `src/core/archive/manifest.ts` writes into every manifest — the ONE
 *      list, so a reader of the doc and a reader of the artifact agree.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT. Leg 1 catches the formulations, not every paraphrase — a new
 * wording of the same false promise passes it. What keeps the truth pinned is
 * leg 2 (the page must name the real door) and the behavioural gates on the
 * doors themselves; leg 1 is the regression net over the sentences that were
 * actually written.
 *
 * HERMETIC: reads docs/ and engineering/ and imports one constant module
 * (`manifest.ts` has no config, no DB). No network, no clock.
