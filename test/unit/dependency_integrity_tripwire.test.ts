/**
 * DEPENDENCY INTEGRITY TRIPWIRE (DEC-12) — every third-party byte this engine
 * installs or serves is pinned by a digest, and there is no third way in.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (P2-5, 2026-08-24). `package.json` declared
 * `"xlsx": "https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/xlsx-0.20.3.tgz"`. A tarball-URL
 * dependency is the one shape bun records WITHOUT integrity: 581 lockfile entries
 * carried `sha512-`, that one carried nothing. It was not an inert dev dependency
 * either — those bytes are served to browsers as `/dedalo/lib/xlsx/xlsx.mjs`
 * (`tools/tool_export/js/tool_export.js`), and a code update re-runs `bun install`
 * in the quarantine, so every update re-fetched unverified third-party client code.
 * One CDN compromise, or one MITM on an installation's network, and the next update
 * writes attacker JavaScript into every export the museum performs.
 *
 * xlsx is now VENDORED (`vendor/xlsx/`). This gate is what stops the shape coming
 * back — anywhere, in any of the three packages that have their own lockfile.
 *
 * THE TWO HALVES, because closing one alone is a false floor:
 *   1. INSTALLED code — no dependency specifier may be a URL/git/file/link, and no
 *      lockfile tuple may resolve to a non-registry URL or lack a `sha512-`/`sha256-`
 *      integrity. That is the package-manager path.
 *   2. COMMITTED code — `vendor/` has no lockfile at all, so its integrity is the
 *      tree digest in `vendor/vendor_manifest.json`. Dirs and manifest rows must be
 *      exact complements (neither an undeclared tree nor a row with no tree), and
 *      every digest must recompute (`scripts/vendor_verify.ts`).
 *
 * THE COMMITTED ARM IS DERIVED, NOT A DIRECTORY (P2-5-residue: CLI-12, PUB-12,
 * OPS-08, 2026-09-04). "Under vendor/" was the census, so seven third-party files
 * committed elsewhere — a byte-identical @huggingface/transformers dist and two
 * EasyQRCodeJS copies under tools/, client-zip under tools/, lz-string and a dead
 * findAndReplaceDOMText UMD under client/, a 16 MB swagger-ui 4.5.2 under
 * publication/ — sat outside every axis for years with this gate green. Now
 * `scripts/lib/third_party_census.ts` reads EVERY tracked js/mjs/cjs/css/less file
 * under the trees that ship (client, deploy, install, publication, tools, vendor)
 * — and every tracked MODEL ARTIFACT there (.onnx/.safetensors/.wasm/…, a
 * tokenizer/config model-card file): the reviewer's re-run of this row found
 * 20 MB of a TranslateGemma tokenizer committed under tools/tool_lang/**, bytes
 * no code-shaped signature could see — and flags the ones wearing a third-party
 * signature and no first-party marker;
 * each must lie under a manifest row's root (`vendor/<id>` or the row's explicit
 * `root`) or be an ENUMERATED, shrink-only exemption with its reason. And every
 * row now declares a `licence` (closed SPDX set + the licence text inside the
 * tree), because redistribution has a fourth question a digest never asked.
 *
 * The lockfile roots are IMPORTED from `scripts/ci/audit.ts`, which already declares
 * that census for `bun audit`. Re-declaring the list here is how a fourth package
 * would end up audited but unguarded.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS.
 *   - This proves a digest EXISTS and matches, never that the bytes are benign. A
 *     pinned malicious release stays pinned and malicious; `scripts/ci/audit.ts`
 *     (advisories) and the vendor staleness print are the other axis.
 *   - Distribution side is NOT covered here. `test/unit/release_archive_tripwire.test.ts`
 *     hashes nothing — it only rejects symlinks in the release archive — so what
 *     protects an installation receiving an update is the update's own archive-sha
 *     refusal, not an independent signature over vendor/.
 *   - Transitive integrity is only as good as bun's own lockfile writer: we assert
 *     the field is present and registry-shaped, not that bun verified it on install.
 *   - The third-party census is LEXICAL. A pretty-printed, unbannered, unmapped
 *     file with no copyright line looks like source to it — the shape of a
 *     hand-pasted snippet. The positive control proves the signatures it has, not
 *     that no other shape exists.
