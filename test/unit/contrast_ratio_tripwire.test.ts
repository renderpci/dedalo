/**
 * CONTRAST RATIO tripwire (DEC-12; audit 2026-08-26 row P1-18, finding CLI-23;
 * WIDENED 2026-09-06 by the CSS coherence audit, DESIGN.md clause 2.c, findings
 * C1 / C4 / C5 / C12).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, FIRST TIME. The light theme — the DEFAULT for every user who
 * never touches the toggle — shipped text/background pairs down to 1.92:1, the
 * brand orange on white at 2.44:1 in every modal title and on the login button.
 * Nothing in the repo computed a ratio: the theme gate checks that a dark token
 * is PAIRED with a light one, and says in its own words that "a paired-but-
 * unreadable dark token still passes"; the duplication gate asserts WHERE a token
 * may be declared, never what it evaluates to. So the palette could be retuned to
 * any value and every gate stayed green.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, SECOND TIME. The first version of this gate read ONE file,
 * `main.css`, under TWO palettes, and excluded the design axis BY NAME. So:
 *   - the 37 runtime-injected tool sheets (334 KB, ~1,800 rules, appended to the
 *     SAME document by `load_style()`) were judged by nothing — 39 sub-AA pairs
 *     in 15 sheets shipped with every gate green, down to 1.61:1
 *     (`tool_print .flow_continuation_badge`) and 1.67:1 (`tool_tc .button_apply`
 *     in dark, `#00e801` on a tool token that dark had re-pointed to white);
 *   - the `[data-design="redesign"]` line — four root palettes that ship in
 *     `main.css` and are one URL parameter away — had no legibility floor at
 *     all: 35 light + 13 dark pairs below AA, minimum 2.17:1, and 29 + 12 of
 *     them were CLASSIC rules re-tokened by the palette, which is precisely the
 *     "paired-but-unreadable token" shape this gate exists to catch;
 *   - the accent axis (`[data-accent="pine"]`) was not even known to exist here,
 *     so `button.warning.new` at 2.69:1 under pine stayed green.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ASSERTS. For every SERVED stylesheet — the set is DERIVED from the
 * build (`entrypoints()` in scripts/build_css.ts, the single source of truth for
 * "what is compiled and shipped"; this gate re-globs nothing) — and for every
 * ROOT PALETTE the served bytes declare — DERIVED from every `:root`/`html`
 * selector carrying only `[data-*=…]` attribute constraints, so the (theme ×
 * design × accent) combinations are read off the CSS, not listed here by name —
 * every rule that declares BOTH a foreground and a background colour meets the
 * WCAG 2.1 relative-luminance contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (3:1 where the same rule
 * declares large text, SC 1.4.3's own exception), scored only under the
 * palettes its selector CAN match (`:not([data-theme="dark"])` is never scored
 * in dark; a `[data-design="redesign"]` rule is never scored in classic).
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT MODEL, because getting it wrong fills the gate with false reds:
 * a tool sheet is injected into the document that ALREADY carries `main.css`, so
 * its `var()` chains resolve against the core palette PLUS its own root
 * declarations — never against the tool sheet alone (which would resolve most
 * tokens to nothing and judge nothing). The token map is composed in
 * SPECIFICITY-then-SOURCE order across the sheets of the document: a
 * `:root[data-theme="dark"]` from any sheet (0,2,0) outranks a bare `:root`
 * from any sheet (0,1,0) regardless of load order, and between equal
 * specificity the later sheet wins (the tool sheet is appended after main.css).
 * The audit's first measurement overlaid tokens in FILE order, reported 5 false
 * reds and missed 2 real ones (tool_tc, tool_ontology_parser); the positive
 * control below plants exactly that shape and demands the right answer.
 * `main.css` itself is judged as its own document: `css_token_duplication_tripwire`
 * proves no tool re-declares an OWNED palette name, so no injected sheet can
 * re-point a core token under a core rule.
 *
 * THE CORPUS IS THE BUILT CSS, ON PURPOSE. The `.css` is what the browser gets
 * (deploy is a checkout; production never compiles LESS), and it is the only
 * artifact where the pairs that actually CO-OCCUR in one rule are visible — a
 * pure-token derivation can compute ratios for pairs nobody ever writes and
 * cannot see the ones that matter. `css_build_tripwire` proves every served file
 * is a byte-exact compile of its `.less`, so reading the built file is reading
 * the sources; and `css_source_tripwire` proves the sources are tracked.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE — stated because the audit measured it, and because
 * overclaiming in a header is the exact failure it found:
 *   - A rule that declares a colour and INHERITS its background from an ancestor
 *     is not a pair here: no static reading of a stylesheet resolves the cascade.
 *     That is MOST colour rules (366 of 617 in main.css inherit their
 *     background; only ~190 are judgeable per palette). Move `color` to a child
 *     and a failing pair VANISHES from this gate with the pixels unchanged.
 *     That half belongs to the axe pass inside the browser tier
 *     (`client_a11y_budget_tripwire`), which judges the RENDERED tree.
 *   - `color-mix()`, gradients, `background-image`, `opacity` and a TRANSLUCENT
 *     background over an unknown parent are computed by the browser, not here:
 *     such rules are declared UNJUDGEABLE and skipped (the previous version
 *     composited translucent backgrounds over `--bg_app` and reported
 *     `tool_print .rc_btn:hover` at 1.05:1 on an always-white page — a guess is
 *     not a measurement).
 *   - Cascade SHADOWING between rules is not modelled: a pair in a rule that a
 *     higher-specificity rule always overrides is still scored (a false red that
 *     an exemption must name with its proof), and the pair that actually paints
 *     there may go unjudged. `@media` wrappers are transparent — a pair inside
 *     `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` is scored under every palette.
 *   - Whether a sheet is actually loaded into a document, or which document: the
 *     STANDALONE set below is a DECLARATION (JS `load_style()` strings are the
 *     wire; `css_corpus_tripwire` owns the classification).
 *   - Non-text contrast (SC 1.4.11, borders and icons) and focus indication.
 *
 * FLOORS are stated AT the measured corpus (2026-09-06), not far below it, so a
 * refactor that silently empties a leg turns this gate RED instead of green:
 * the set of files read must EQUAL the derived served set (a sheet that stops
 * parsing reds the set check, not a count — 22 of 42 non-main sheets have zero
 * judgeable pairs, so a per-sheet pair floor would be either vacuous or a pin),
 * every derived palette must resolve > 150 tokens, and the pairs judged are
 * floored PER CORPUS (main, tools) — not as one sum a big corpus could hide a
 * vanished small one inside.
 *
 * EXEMPTIONS are enumerated below, keyed (sheet, selector, palette), one reason
 * each, shrink-only; an exemption whose pair no longer fails is red.
