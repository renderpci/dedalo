/**
 * THE AUDIT'S OWN OPEN QUESTIONS STAY ANSWERED OR STAY NAMED (CLOSURE-openquestions).
 *
 * The 2026-08-26 deep audit closed with fourteen questions its filed severities
 * depend on (`raw/canonical_register.md` §5.2) and three measurements it OWES
 * rather than defers. A closure record that answers twelve of them and quietly
 * drops two reads as complete — which is the exact failure mode the register
 * warned about when it wrote the list down.
 *
 * THE CENSUS IS TOTAL AND IT IS DERIVED FROM THE REGISTER, not from a hand list
 * here: the questions are parsed out of §5.2's own bullets, so a bullet ADDED
 * there and not answered in CLOSURE.md reds this gate, and a hand list cannot
 * drift from the source. The floor refuses a parse that collapses (a heading
 * rename, a reformat) to zero or to fewer than the fourteen of record.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ENTRY MUST CARRY, and why each leg exists:
 *  - a VERDICT token, ANSWERED or OPEN. A paragraph with neither is prose, not
 *    a decision input.
 *  - ANSWERED ⇒ at least one CITATION that resolves on disk. "Answered" without
 *    evidence is an assertion; a citation that names a deleted file is worse
 *    than none, because it reads as evidence.
 *  - OPEN ⇒ a "What would answer it" line. An open question with no stated
 *    resolution path is an excuse.
 *  - EVERY citation in the block must resolve, ANSWERED or not — a dead path
 *    anywhere in the section is a stale record.
 *  - the three OWED measurements must each be named in the block.
 *
 * The detectors are pure functions over text, and the whole record check is ONE
 * function ({@link auditVerdicts}) over ONE reader ({@link readAuditRecord}), so
 * every leg runs twice through the SAME code: once against the real record, and
 * once against a SITUATION this gate BUILDS — a synthetic audit tree (a register
 * with a §5.2 of fourteen bullets, a CLOSURE.md with its delimited block, the
 * evidence files it cites) written into a scratch directory. The clean situation
 * must pass every leg; each planted offence (a collapsed parse, a lost block, an
 * unanswered bullet, a register bullet added later, an evidence-less ANSWERED,
 * a resolution-less OPEN, a dead citation elsewhere, an unnamed owed
 * measurement) must red EXACTLY its own leg. The situation legs run EVERYWHERE,
 * because they need no artifact — the gate's LOGIC is verified on every host.
 *
 * (!) THE ARTIFACT IS LOCAL-ONLY. `audits/` is gitignored, exactly like
 * `rewrite/`, so on a clone neither the register nor CLOSURE.md exists. This
 * gate therefore reads them DEFENSIVELY (never at import, never throwing) and
 * declares itself skipped, with the reason in the test name, when the audit
 * tree is absent — instead of dying at module load on every checkout that is
 * not the maintainer's. Where the artifact IS present, every leg below is
 * enforced in full. What cannot be honestly claimed is that the REAL register is
 * checked on CI: the artifact it gates does not ship. The built situation proves
 * the checker; only the maintainer's tree proves the record.
