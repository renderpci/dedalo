/**
 * TM EPOCH TRIPWIRE (P0-14, second half) — every reader of a record's
 * time-machine history is narrowed to that record's GENERATION.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT. `matrix_time_machine` keys history by `(section_tipo,
 * section_id)` — the address — and nothing else. Where an id was re-minted, a
 * DEAD record's rows carry the living record's exact coordinates. A reader that
 * does not narrow by the generation epoch therefore serves the dead record's
 * snapshots as the living record's own, and a restore built on it writes the
 * dead record's values in with `ok:true`.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A CONVENTION. The narrowing is spliced by hand, because
 * `tmEpochPredicate()` is a SQL fragment spliced into other people's queries —
 * `NARROWED_READERS` / `EXEMPT_TM_READERS` below hold the count (no number goes
 * in prose). Nothing about adding a new TM reader makes its author think of
 * this file. `readTimeMachineHistory` is `withTmHistory`-narrowed, and that is
 * pinned by an OUTCOME in test/unit/record_generation_native.test.ts
 * ("readTimeMachineHistory serves only the living generation"), because
 * `time_machine.ts` is exempt from this census.
 *
 * The census measures CODE: comments are stripped by the shared scanner
 * (test/helpers/strip_comments.ts), so prose naming the table or a helper is
 * neither a statement nor a narrowing.
 *
 * THE TWO DIRECTIONS BOTH MATTER. A leaking reader shows a dead record's
 * history; a leaking WRITE-GATE probe (delete_record, observers) sees the dead
 * generation's rows, concludes the record already has history, and SUPPRESSES
 * the reborn record's own backfill.
 *
 * EXEMPTIONS ARE NAMED, NOT ASSUMED, and the counter floors are the important
 * ones: they exist precisely to witness DEAD generations' ids so the allocator
 * cannot re-mint them. Narrowing those would re-open the FIRST half of P0-14.
 * The two halves pull in opposite directions and both are right.
