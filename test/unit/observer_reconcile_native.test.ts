/**
 * Observer mirror RECONCILE law — TS-native gate for the exported
 * recomputeExternalRelation (the one law both the live save cascade and
 * scripts/observer_reconcile.ts replay).
 *
 * Scenario pinned = the reported production drift (dc1 §2, 2026-07-24): a
 * referencing record written WITHOUT the save chokepoint (raw INSERT — the
 * bulk-import/migration shape; the matrix_relation_index trigger still
 * indexes it) leaves the term's hierarchy93 mirror missing. The gate drives
 * the reconcile law through its full life cycle:
 *   dry-run detects the drift without writing → repair writes the exact
 *   mirror byte-shape + the TM audit pair → second run is a no-op
 *   (idempotent) → a masked swap (one referencer bypass-deleted, another
 *   bypass-inserted) proves the adjudication is MEMBERSHIP-based, not
 *   length-based, and that BOTH halves now persist → a pure bypass DELETE
 *   makes the recompute a shrink, and THE SHRINK APPLIES → duplicating the
 *   term proves covered-observer mirror slots are STRIPPED at copy (empty by
 *   construction — never the source's byte-copied referencer bag).
 *
 * 2026-08-06: the blanket GROW-ONLY fail-safe and its `allowShrink` opt-in are
 * RETIRED (see observer_failsafe_native.test.ts's header for why). The two
 * shrink tests here used to assert that a legitimate removal was WITHHELD;
 * they now assert it is applied, which is the regression guard for the
 * reported numisdata36 equivalence bug. The only remaining withholder is a
 * DEGRADED SEED, gated in the failsafe file.
 *
 * Environment: suite DB. Every section, component and record is built by this
 * file — a reserved `zzobs` scratch ontology (situations/situation.ts) whose
 * records land in whatever table the section's own `matrix_table` resolves to —
 * and `dropSituation` sweeps it whole in afterAll, with the residue ASSERTED 0.

// Migrated to the generic `test` TLD 2026-08-20 (AGENTS.md hard rules). The
// shipped edge this drove — hierarchy93 ← rsc387, hosted at the install section
// `on1` (matrix_hierarchy, planted by test/helpers/observer_term_seed.ts) with
// referencers on `rsc205` (matrix) — is rebuilt here as MIRROR ← INDEXER on two
// scratch sections carrying the `test24` matrix_table relation, so every record
// lands in `matrix_test`. The observer properties are copied field for field
// from the shipped pair (component_autocomplete_hi + config_relation dd96 on
// one side; component_autocomplete + use_observable_dato + set_dato_external on
// the other).
//
// The `--section` narrowing case needed a MULTI-HOST observer, which it took
// from hierarchy93's three shipped forward specs (on1/ts1/dc1) — a fact of one
// install's ontology. INDEXER now declares TWO forward specs of its own
// (TERM_SECTION and TERM_SECTION_B), so the multi-tuple/one-tuple contrast is
// built rather than borrowed.
//
// The `planted` guard and skipUnlessPlanted() went with the migration. They
// existed because on a restored live snapshot `on1/58` is a REAL record whose
// mirror a repair write would silently rewrite; the sections here exist because
// this file created them, so there is no such record and no case may skip.
// skipUnlessSuiteDb() below is UNCHANGED — it guards dd_ontology writes, which
// is a different hazard.

/**
 * THE SWEEP'S OWN NARROWING + CENSUS FOLD (2026-08-08 mutation-repair pass).
 *
 * The gates above drive the reconciler only through ONE fully-specified
 * (--observer + --section + --id) call, so three of its own laws were never
 * entered and survived mutation:
 *   1. `--section` narrowing (discoverTuples' LAST line — the filter whose
 *      comment records the tchi1 starvation bug from filtering too early);
 *   2. `--id` MEMBERSHIP (candidateIds: an id that is neither a referenced
 *      target nor a stored mirror holder must yield NO candidate — otherwise
 *      `--id N --apply` recomputes and WRITES an arbitrary record outside the
 *      tuple's candidate set);
 *   3. the degraded-seed census FOLD (`summary.degradedSeedRecords`) — the
 *      number the shrink budget adjudicates. It was only ever fed to
 *      exceedsShrinkBudget as a hand-built literal; nothing proved the sweep
 *      ever produces it.
 *
 * Fixture: a scratch REVERSE-ONLY observer edge (test999… namespace, the
 * registry's suite-DB diagnostics carve-out) whose `data_from_field` names a
 * peer with no ontology node — the measured degraded-seed shape — plus one
 * scratch REF_SECTION record holding a stale mirror entry nothing references. That
 * makes the sweep's answer deterministic (1 tuple, 1 candidate, 1 withheld
 * drop) instead of hostage to whatever the suite ontology happens to carry.
 * Every call here is a DRY RUN: the fold and the narrowing are readable
 * without writing, and a mutant that writes is the thing we are guarding.
