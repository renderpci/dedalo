/**
 * A LIST PAINT COSTS ONE COUNT, NOT ONE PER PAINT (PERF-09 + PERF-10).
 *
 * The paginator total is the most expensive statement of an ordinary list
 * paint (a ~2.5 s parallel index-only scan on a 33 M-row section), and it is
 * the same number until the section is written to. The assembler used to serve
 * it from a cache in exactly one case — an UNFILTERED browse of a
 * policy-governed log table — which is the case a curator almost never is in:
 * a NON-ADMIN's projects predicate lands in `whereParts`, so the short-circuit
 * could never fire for them and every single paint re-counted the section.
 *
 * MEASURED BEHAVIOURALLY, never on the implementation: this gate counts the
 * statements the engine actually issues while ASSEMBLING a paint, through the
 * engine's own query tap (db/query_tap.ts). What it pins:
 *  - a second identical paint issues ZERO count statements, for the bare
 *    browse AND for the ACL-scoped one;
 *  - a paint carrying a CLIENT FILTER is never served from the cache (the
 *    total is request-specific and must be counted every time);
 *  - the cache key discriminates by ACL scope — two different rendered
 *    predicates never read each other's total;
 *  - the TTL FLOOR expires a stamp, so an out-of-band writer (a sibling
 *    worker, an importer, psql) cannot be served a stale total forever.
 *
 * SITUATION: the zzscale corpus for the bare browse (a section nothing else in
 * the suite counts, so the first paint is a real cold miss) and the `test`
 * TLD's own playground section for the ACL one. Built here, torn down here.
