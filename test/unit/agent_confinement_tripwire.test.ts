/**
 * TRIPWIRE — an agent turn is a DIFFERENT PRINCIPAL from the daemon that starts it
 * (PUB-01 / P1-21).
 *
 * The audit's finding was not that a directive was missing. It was that every boundary the
 * site-builder daemon draws around a coding agent — a closed environment key set, a
 * realpath-proved cwd, a HOME outside the workspaces, a pinned git remote, a unit hardened
 * to `ProtectSystem=strict` — described a child that then ran AS THE DAEMON'S OWN UID. No
 * filesystem mode and no `Protect*` directive separates a process from itself, so the
 * shared bearer under `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY`, every provider key and the append handle on
 * the audit trail were readable to text a language model wrote, and stealing the bearer is
 * full daemon control including the irreversible deletion of a museum's published site.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS, and why it is here rather than in the package's own suite: the
 * package suite runs only when the package's files change (`scripts/verify.ts`), and three
 * of the four properties below live in files a reader would not think of as the site
 * builder's — the ownership matrix, the rendered env, the polkit rule. It is also the
 * CENSUS: every process-creating call site in the daemon's source is enumerated here, so
 * the next one cannot be added without a decision about what it runs as.
 *
 *   §1 THE CENSUS. Every file under `publication/site_builder/src/` that can start a process —
 *      derived from its IMPORTS (`child_process`, `cluster`, `bun`, `bun:ffi`, `module`, and the
 *      evaluators `vm`, `worker_threads`, `inspector`, `repl`) and its scope-resolved references
 *      (aliases, namespaces, the `Bun` global, `Bun.$`), never from a call's spelling — with a
 *      floor; each one an enumerated exemption carrying its reason and its EXACT reference and
 *      import counts. A dynamic import or require of a process module, a re-export of one, and
 *      the escapes no binding names (the loader/evaluator globals incl. `Worker` and `Reflect`,
 *      a non-literal `require`, a non-inert `process` member — the global or `node:process`
 *      imported — `import.meta.require`, a `.constructor` access) are refused everywhere.
 *   §2 THE UNIT. The three directives that are about the agent rather than the daemon
 *      (`ProtectProc=invisible`, `RestrictSUIDSGID`, `LockPersonality`), beside the
 *      hardening set that was already there — asserted on a real render.
 *   §3 THE AUTHORIZATION. The rendered polkit rule: this museum's service user, `manage-units`,
 *      STOP and KILL — never START (F2: polkit sees no run-as uid) — on the socket-activated
 *      instances of this museum's DECLARED sites' root-rendered units, enumerated (LEAD-1b).
 *      The daemon starts nothing: PID 1 starts a run when the daemon connects to a socket.
 *   §4 THE RECORDED DECISION. One agent identity per DECLARED SITE (LEAD-1b) — the choice,
 *      what it does not draw, and what would change it, written beside the derivation.
 *   §5 THE PROVISIONED HOST IS CONFINED BY CONSTRUCTION. The rendered env states the mode,
 *      the site identities and the socket directory, so the daemon's production refusal
 *      never has to fire; each site's units are rendered by root with `User=` its identity.
 *   §6 THE OTHER DOOR. A build step, an install script and a `git add` are agent-authored
 *      text too, executed on a routine publisher-triggered path. No module that runs a
 *      command inside a site workspace may reach the UNCONFINED runner: `util/spawn.ts` is
 *      imported by the confinement and the version probes, and by nothing else — read off the
 *      MODULE GRAPH (resolved specifiers), with any dynamic reach or re-export of it refused.
 *   §7 THE TREE THE TWO UIDS SHARE. The modes that make a confined turn able to write at
 *      all — one constant for the provisioned roots and the runtime workspaces — and the
 *      audit trail closed to the group the agent is in. Plus the two censuses that keep the
 *      tree's DOORS in one module: every path-based MUTATION and every path-based CONTENT
 *      READ under `src/` — read off the fs IMPORTS and their scope-resolved bindings, never a
 *      call's spelling — each enumerated with a destination, because a lexical
 *      `confinedPath` follows a planted link in both directions — the write plant truncates
 *      the daemon's own audit trail, and the read plant serves the daemon's own
 *      `SERVICE_TOKEN` back through `GET /sites/<slug>/builds/<id>`.
 *   §8 THE EGRESS. Every door (turn / build / git) renders a PRIVATE network namespace, a
 *      masked `/run` and `IPAddressDeny=any`; the only reachable path is the door's own
 *      site's `/run/dedalo-egress` sockets (none on git) — asked at 255 (no PID namespace:
 *      nothing of the same uid runs beside a site's run, the per-site identity and its
 *      Conflicts= doors, G6) and at 257 beside a CONCURRENT same-uid run (the extra layer),
 *      and of the host's IPC namespace. Evaluated with a model of systemd
 *      whose filter is ALLOW-WINS — and whose control row, the pre-fix shape
 *      (`IPAddressAllow=any localhost` + a deny list), must come out UNSAFE, or the model is
 *      the longest-prefix misreading that made LEAD-1 look closed. Egress plans are
 *      hostname-only. HONEST LIMIT: the kernel's behaviour is proved by the VM probe, not here.
 *
 * The BEHAVIOUR of a confined run — the socket, the spec, the gate, the refusals, the
 * per-turn credential — is the package's own gate,
 * `publication/site_builder/tests/agent_confinement.test.ts` (and LEAD-1b's lease,
 * conformance and per-site reach, `publication/site_builder/tests/lead1b_*.test.ts`). This
 * one is the invariant scan around it.

 * The corpus
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * WHAT COUNTS AS STARTING A PROCESS — read off what a file can REACH, never off how a call is
 * spelled.
 *
 * The first census matched call SPELLINGS (`Bun.spawn(`, a bare `spawn(`/`execFile(`/…) and
 * was answered, measured, by every respelling of the same decision: `import { spawn as run }`
 * + `run(…)`, `import * as cp` + `cp.spawn(…)`, ``Bun.$`…` ``, and
 * `const { spawn: s } = await import('node:child_process')`. Its exemptions were keyed per FILE
 * with a liveness floor of ONE call, so a fifth spawn added to a file that already had four was
 * invisible. A regression that ran `git`/`bun install` in a workspace through such a spelling
 * would execute agent-authored hooks as the daemon uid, around `util/spawn`'s `CONFINED_ARGV`
 * door, with this census green. So the census is now built from the module graph:
 *
 *   1. THE IMPORT SIDE (`Bun.Transpiler.scanImports`: static, dynamic and `require`). A
 *      process-capable module (`PROCESS_MODULES`) may be imported only STATICALLY and only by
 *      an exempt file. A dynamic import or a `require` of one yields bindings no scan resolves,
 *      so it is refused everywhere, exempt files included.
 *   2. THE REFERENCE SIDE, scope-aware. The file is transpiled (types and comments gone), its
 *      process imports are removed, and each binding they made — default, named, aliased,
 *      namespace — and the `Bun` global are DEFINED to a sentinel. `define` replaces only
 *      UNBOUND identifier references: never a string, a comment, a property name or a local
 *      that shadows the binding. Every sentinel left is one process-capable reference.
 *      `Bun.<member>` counts unless the member is in the closed inert list (`BUN_INERT`); a
 *      bare `Bun` (an alias, a destructure) always counts.
 *   3. THE ESCAPES no binding names are refused EVERYWHERE, exempt files included — and they are
 *      found the same scope-aware way, not by spelling: every GLOBAL that reaches a loader or an
 *      evaluator (`globalThis`, `global`, `self`, `window`, `eval`, `Function`, `module`) is
 *      `define`d to a sentinel, so `global.Bun.spawn` / `self.Bun` / `Function('return Bun')()`
 *      are references however spelled while a local of that name or a string ('self' in a CSP)
 *      is not; `require` is allowed only as a direct call with a literal of a NON-process module;
 *      `process` only through a CLOSED list of inert members (`PROCESS_INERT` — so
 *      `process.getBuiltinModule`, `process.mainModule.require`, `process.binding`, a computed
 *      `process[…]` are escapes); `import.meta` only as `dir`/`url`/`main`/… (so
 *      `import.meta.require` is one); a `.constructor` access (`(() => {}).constructor` IS
 *      `Function`); and a computed `import(…)` / `require(…)`. `node:module` (`createRequire`)
 *      is a process module.
 *   4. RE-EXPORTS. `export { spawnSync as x } from 'node:child_process'` (or `export *`) makes
 *      no local binding — the reference count does not move while every importer of the file
 *      holds a spawn — so a re-export of a process module is refused everywhere.
 *   5. EXACT COUNTS. Each exemption pins its reference count AND its static import count, as
 *      `sql_confinement` pins its sites: one more (or one fewer) is red, and a new one is a
 *      decision in review.

/**
 * WHO STILL MUTATES THE FILESYSTEM BY PATH — the census, TOTAL over `src/`.
 *
 * Two defects, one wiring. `mkdir(dir, {recursive:true})` and `writeFile(path, body)` take
 * the daemon's umask (0027 on a provisioned host), so a module that reaches for them writes
 * a site directory the agent uid cannot enter and a `site.json` it cannot edit. And a
 * path-based write FOLLOWS LINKS: `confinedPath` is lexical, so a link planted where the
 * daemon writes redirects the daemon's own uid out of the tree.
 *
 * THE SCOPE IS THE WHOLE TREE, AND THE QUESTION IS THE DESTINATION. The first version of
 * this census scoped itself to `sites/`, `context/` and `build/` — the directories the fix
 * had touched — which is exactly the shape of a census that answers about itself: measured
 * afterwards, `sites/git.ts` (the `.git/info/exclude` rewritten on EVERY commit), BOTH
 * drivers' MCP configs (which carry the museum's Publication API key) and `sessions/store.ts`
 * (every event of every turn) were all still path-based, and three of the four were not even
 * scanned. So every `.ts` file under `src/` is scanned.
 *
 * AND THE SPELLING IS NOT THE SUBJECT EITHER. The second version required the `(` to follow
 * the bare name, so every `*Sync` variant, `Bun.write(` and `createWriteStream(` were
 * invisible — measured: a planted `src/zz_probe.ts` doing `mkdirSync(<workspace>, {recursive:
 * true})` + `writeFileSync(<workspace>/y.txt, body)` passed this census GREEN, and
 * `sites/webspace.ts` had been writing with `writeFileSync` all along, neither found nor
 * exempted. The name is matched with an optional `Sync`, plus `open`/`openSync` (an
 * `O_CREAT` open is a write), `Bun.write` and `createWriteStream`.
 *
 * AN EXEMPTION MUST SAY WHY A PLANTED LINK AT ITS DESTINATION CANNOT REDIRECT IT, and there
 * are only two honest answers: the destination is OUTSIDE `SITES_ROOT` and outside every
 * workspace, or the call REFUSES a planted name by construction (`O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`, or
 * `symlink(2)`, which creates a link and never writes through one). Never "its modes are
 * someone else's business".

 * then hands the bytes to the museum's own API. MEASURED on this package's own fixture, with
 * agent-uid actions only: `rm -rf .builder; mkdir -p .builder/builds; echo '{"id":"b1",…}' >
 * b1.json; ln -s <the daemon's service env> b1.log` made `getBuildLog` return

 * is PUB-01's stated impact ("read the daemon's SERVICE_TOKEN / .env / the actor audit log")
 * reproducing THROUGH the fix for PUB-01. `getBuild`, `readManifest`, `replayEvents`,
 * `readMeta` and `listSessions` were the same shape.
 *
 * So the same rule, the same scope: every `.ts` file under `src/`, and an exemption states
 * that what it reads is outside `SITES_ROOT` and every workspace. DIRECTORY LISTINGS are not
 * in this regex and that is deliberate — a `readdir` yields NAMES, not content, and every
 * file a name leads to is opened through the doors above; `readdirShared` proves the chain
 * anyway, which is the stronger statement, and the honest limit is that a bare `readdir` of
