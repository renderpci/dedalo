/**
 * OPERATOR-PROCEDURE tripwire (DEC-12: every documented invariant has one).
 *
 * A page in `docs/management/` is not prose about the system — it is the thing an operator
 * types into a root shell on a museum's machine. So it has exactly one failure mode worth
 * gating: IT NAMES SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Until 2026-08-30 `docs/management/site_builder.md` told an operator to
 * install the site-builder daemon by copying files (`install.sh`, a shipped systemd unit, a
 * hand-written vhost) that had been DELETED when the provisioner replaced them, and the
 * cookbook beside it configured the daemon through four environment keys the daemon does
 * not read (`PREPROD_ROOT`, `PROD_ROOT`, `PREPROD_BASE_URL`, `PROD_BASE_URL`) and told the
 * operator to give a site a custom domain by hand-writing a virtual host — which is now a
 * declared field. Following that page end to end produced a NON-WORKING INSTALL, and every
 * gate in the repo was green the whole time: no test read the manual, and the manual read no
 * code.
 *
 * The same silence covered `engineering/PRODUCTION.md` §6, which names the backup SET. A
 * store named there and copied by nothing is a store discovered missing at restore time,
 * which is the worst moment there is.
 *
 * SIX LEGS, each in both directions where a direction exists:
 *
 *   A. Every `provision <verb>` an operator page names is a verb the CLI HAS — and every
 *      verb the CLI has appears in `docs/management/site_builder.md`, so a new one cannot
 *      ship undocumented.
 *   B. Every flag written next to a `provision` command is a real option, AND is one that
 *      that verb accepts. `provision apply --purge-published` used to be accepted and
 *      silently ignored; a doc that teaches it is the same defect one layer up.
 *   C. Every repo script and deploy artifact an operator page names is on disk.
 *   D. Every daemon environment key an operator page names is one the daemon READS
 *      (`publication/site_builder/src/config.ts`) or an engine catalog key. This is the leg
 *      that catches the four dead root keys without anybody maintaining a list of them.
 *   E. The backup set of `PRODUCTION.md` §6 equals what `deploy/dedalo-backup.service`
 *      copies: every documented store's token appears in the unit, every ExecStart carries a
 *      documented store's token, and the counts agree with the prose.
 *   G. Every declaration a page shows an operator is PARSED by the real schema and DERIVED
 *      by the real layout — including the `--declare` fragment, merged over an inference the
 *      way `adopt` merges it. A copy-paste block that does not parse is the most expensive
 *      kind of wrong: the operator finds out with root, on a museum's host, from a refusal
 *      naming a field they did not choose.
 *   F. BEHAVIOURAL: `deploy/dedalo-site-builder-backup.sh` is RUN over a synthetic host and
 *      must copy the instance marker, both release stores and the served symlink AS a
 *      symlink — and must exit non-zero when a source it was told about is absent. A backup
 *      script that has never been run is a hypothesis, not a backup.
 *
 * WHY THE SCANS ONLY READ CODE CONTEXTS. Every extraction below runs over fenced blocks and
 * inline code spans, never over prose. A sentence may legitimately contain the word
 * "provision" followed by anything at all; a command must be a command.
