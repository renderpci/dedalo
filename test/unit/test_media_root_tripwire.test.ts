/**
 * TEST-MEDIA-ROOT TRIPWIRE (DEC-12) — the FILESYSTEM half of "a test never
 * writes to production data", 2026-08-19.
 *
 * `test_db_marker_tripwire` closed the database: the suite runs on a database
 * that says in a row of its own that it is disposable, and every test-data
 * writer asks it. That work LEDGERED the surface it left open — `MEDIA_PATH`.
 * The client suite, `ensureMediaKit`, the media unit gates and every tool that
 * builds a derivative wrote into the INSTALLATION's media tree, beside 32 GB of
 * heritage masters that cannot be re-acquired.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM THIS GATE GUARDS, in one line: `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT` both
 * REPOINTS the media root and ARMS a refusal, and every door that resolves a
 * media root asks the directory for a `.dedalo_test_media` marker before it
 * writes. One key does both halves so a run cannot be armed at the installation's
 * root, nor repointed with the guard asleep (src/core/media/test_media_root.ts;
 * src/config/config.ts `buildMediaConfig`).
 *
 * SIX RULES, each with an anti-vacuity probe:
 *
 *  1. INVENTORY — DERIVED, not enumerated. Every file under `src/` and `tools/`
 *     that RESOLVES a media root (reads `config.media.rootPath`, comments
 *     stripped) either passes it through the guard, or delegates to a resolver
 *     that does (`requireMediaRoot`), or carries a NAMED reason in
 *     `EXEMPT_RESOLVERS`. A new door that forgets is caught by derivation, and a
 *     stale exemption is a failure — a dead exemption widens the law silently.
 *  2. REFUSAL, PROVED ON THE REAL DOORS. Each door is pointed at an UNMARKED
 *     temp root and must refuse naming itself, having written NOTHING (the
 *     directory is read back and must still be empty); then at a MARKED root,
 *     where it must succeed. A guard nobody proves in both directions is a guard
 *     that may be refusing for some other reason, or not refusing at all.
 *  3. THE MARKER LITERAL AGREES IN BOTH PLACES. It is spelled twice by
 *     necessity: `test/helpers/test_media_root.ts` runs in the preload, BEFORE
 *     `src/config/config.ts` may be imported (importing it there would freeze
 *     the media root and the DB connection at the installation's values), so it
 *     cannot import the canonical constant. This asserts the copy is identical.
 *  4. THE SEAM IS ACTUALLY ON, in this very process, and the root it names is
 *     marked and is NOT the installation's.
 *  5. ONE SETTER PER TIER, and no more. Exactly three places set the key — the
 *     `bun test` preload, `scripts/test_db_setup.ts` (which sweeps and rebuilds
 *     the tree) and `scripts/client_test_server.ts` (which hands it to the
 *     server it spawns) — and the preload is registered in `bunfig.toml`. A
 *     fourth setter, or a missing preload line, is how a tier quietly stops
 *     being covered.
 *  6. DB↔TREE PAIRING (2026-08-25, the parallel-shard work). A shard database is
 *     a clone (`<template>__shard<N>`), and its media tree must FOLLOW that name
 *     through `testMediaRootPath()` — NO shard-tier file sets
 *     `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT`. Setting both halves by hand is precisely how they
 *     come to disagree; the `<app>_test_test` debris this header records was that
 *     bug at N=1, and at N shards it can hand two shards ONE tree over TWO
 *     databases, where one shard's sweep deletes the other's corpus media
 *     mid-assertion. The tier is DERIVED (the provisioner plus its importers) and
 *     the forbidden-setter half is presence-gated on
 *     `scripts/lib/test_shard_db.ts`, written in parallel with this gate; the
 *     PAIRING half is behavioural and binds now — basename == database name, no
 *     two shards share a tree, no shard tree is (or contains, or is inside) the
 *     template's, and the DEFAULT derivation follows `DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE`, which
 *     is what makes "the runner sets only the database" a mechanism rather than a
 *     hope.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT. This proves that every door RESOLVING a root asks the marker,
 * and that the doors refuse. It does not prove a module cannot compose an
 * absolute media path from parts it read out of `files_info` without ever
 * calling a resolver — the confinement chokepoint (`assertInsideMediaRoot`) is
 * what covers that direction, and it too resolves through `requireMediaRoot`.
 *
 * And rule 6's forbidden-setter half does not run while `scripts/lib/test_shard_db.ts`
 * is absent. What it leaves open is only "the provisioner exists and obeys" —
 * rule 5's three-setter census still refuses a fourth setter anywhere under
 * `scripts/`, shard tier or not, and rule 6b's pairing proof runs either way.
 *
 * Registered in engineering/TRIPWIRES.md + scripts/verify.ts.

/**
 * WHY THIS RULE EXISTS (2026-08-25, the parallel-shard work).
 *
 * A sharded run gives each child process its own database — `<template>__shardN`,
 * a `CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE` clone, because the 7612 MB suite fixture cannot
 * be built N times. The database and the media tree are ONE fixture (`files_info`
 * rows in the database name files in the tree, test/helpers/test_media_root.ts),
 * so each shard needs its own tree too — and there are exactly two ways to give
 * it one:
 *
 *   (a) let it FOLLOW the database name through `testMediaRootPath()`, which
 *       keys the tree by the suite database and is already what the `bun test`
 *       preload calls; or
 *   (b) have the shard runner set `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT` itself, beside
 *       `DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE`.
 *
 * (b) IS THE BUG CLASS THIS FILE'S OWN HEADER ALREADY RECORDS. Setting the two
 * halves by hand is how they come to disagree: the measured `<app>_test_test`
 * debris came from exactly that — one side derived the name, the other passed
 * it, and the two landed in different directories with the database rows of one
 * fixture pointing at the files of another. With N shards the same mistake is
 * worse than debris: two shards can be handed the SAME tree while holding
 * DIFFERENT databases, and the corpus media one plants is deleted by the other's
 * sweep mid-assertion, with a failure naming a missing file nowhere near the
 * cause.
 *
 * So the law is (a), and it is stated negatively because that is the half a
 * runner can violate: NO shard-tier file sets `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT`. Rule 5
 * already pins the setter census to three files and would catch a fourth; this
 * rule says WHY the shard tier is not the fourth, and — the part rule 5 cannot
 * express — proves the derivation actually pairs, so "follow the database name"
 * is a mechanism rather than a hope.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT ENUMERATED, and PRESENCE-GATED the same way rule 7 of
 * test_db_marker_tripwire is: `scripts/lib/test_shard_db.ts` is being written in
 * parallel with this gate. The tier is computed (the provisioner, plus every
 * file under `scripts/` that imports it), so a runner added later is covered the
 * day it lands; the pairing half below is BEHAVIOURAL and binds right now,
 * whether or not the provisioner exists.
