/**
 * RQO SCALAR BOUND TRIPWIRE — every string an unauthenticated or cheap-to-call
 * door can put into the engine declares a maximum (audit 2026-08-26 SEC-21).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `rqoSchema` typed 54 scalars as a bare `z.string()` and the
 * `options` bag as `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`. `dd_utils_api` login
 * does `String(options.username ?? '')`, the body ceiling is 256 MiB and the
 * shipped nginx configs allow `client_max_body_size 300m`, so ONE unauthenticated
 * POST measured 67,109,061 bytes durably written to `matrix_activity` in 3.16 s.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE MEASURES — outcomes, never spellings:
 *
 *  1. TOTAL CENSUS, derived from the SCHEMA TREE ITSELF (not from the source
 *     text, which a rename or a helper would defeat): every `ZodString` leaf
 *     reachable from `rqoSchema` — through objects, unions, arrays, records,
 *     optionals and the recursive `z.lazy` SQO filter — must report a
 *     `maxLength`. A field declared with a helper counts; a field declared with
 *     a bare `z.string()` does not, whatever it is called.
 *  1b. A DOOR'S BOUND IS NEVER TIGHTER THAN THE BEHAVIOUR THE ENGINE SHIPS.
 *     TOTAL over the handler tree (dynamic import + source read, floor >15
 *     files, dd_identify_api and dd_mcp_api asserted reached): every exported
 *     numeric cap above the undeclared-remainder ceiling must have an `options`
 *     key the handler READS whose per-key budget is >= that cap. Charging only
 *     the keys already listed in `OPTIONS_KEY_BUDGETS` is what let
 *     `options.image` (dd_identify_api, 8 MiB photographs) be refused at 512 KiB
 *     with every gate green. Planted positive control: a synthetic 9 MB cap read
 *     from an unbudgeted key is flagged.
 *  2. The PARSE DOOR actually refuses: an oversize scalar and an oversize
 *     `options` bag are `false` from `rqoSchema.safeParse`, and an ordinary RQO
 *     still parses. This is the property that matters — the census only says
 *     WHY it holds.
 *  3. Every pre-auth action (derived from dispatch's `NO_LOGIN_ACTIONS`, never a
 *     hand list) is reached through that same door, so no unauthenticated caller
 *     has a path with looser bounds.
 *  4. Every shipped nginx config that proxies the API declares a request-rate
 *     ceiling — the hop in front of the engine, which costs the engine nothing.
 *  5. THE CENSUS DOES NOT STOP AT THE SCHEMA. A string that is in bounds at the
 *     door can still become durable bytes at ~2x if a downstream key is built by
 *     concatenating it: `login_attempts.attempt_key` (plus its index) is written
 *     twice per denial, and a 520 KB username — legal under the 512 KiB bag
 *     ceiling, since no real username earns a per-key declaration — measured
 *     2.08 MB of sqlite per unauthenticated denial. So this gate also measures
 *     the OUTCOME at the construction site: the throttle-key builders bound
 *     EVERY untrusted component — the identity AND the source, which is a
 *     caller-written X-Forwarded-For hop under a trusted-hop count >= 2 — and a
 *     flood of oversize denials on both axes leaves kilobytes rather than
 *     megabytes attributable to those keys.
 *
 * MUTATION-VERIFIED: removing `.max()` from one field, removing the options-bag
 * ceiling, and removing `limit_req` from one shipped config each turn a leg RED.
