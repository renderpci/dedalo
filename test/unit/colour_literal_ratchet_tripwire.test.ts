/**
 * COLOUR LITERAL RATCHET tripwire (DEC-12; CSS coherence audit 2026-09, clause 2.d,
 * findings C9 / C18 / S1 / S3 / S10).
 *
 * WHAT IS WRONG. A colour written as a literal — `#f78a1c`, `rgb(255 255 255 / 80%)`,
 * `'#006ed2'` in a JS style string — is a paint that CANNOT follow the palette. When
 * the brand orange was retuned on 2026-09-05 every `var(--color_orange_dedalo)` site
 * moved and every literal copy of the same orange stayed where it was, silently
 * becoming a second, private brand. Nothing in the repo counted them: the duplication
 * gate asserts WHO may declare a token, the contrast gate judges the fg/bg pair a rule
 * declares, the palette-axis gate asserts a NAME is declared for every axis. A literal
 * belongs to none of those questions and is invisible to all three.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A RATCHET AND NOT A PROHIBITION. Many literals are legitimately
 * non-tokenizable — a mask-image stop, an SVG fill inside a `data:` URI, a shadow
 * `rgba()` where only the alpha varies, a QR module colour, a third-party widget
 * override. "No literals" is therefore not a true rule, and a gate that asserted it
 * would be exempted into meaninglessness. What IS true is that the number must never
 * grow without a decision. So: classify, bank, shrink-only.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE AUDIT'S RAW CENSUS. The audit's first instrument was
 * a `grep -oiE '#[0-9a-f]{3,8}'` over every `.less` → 429 across 59 files (seed S1), and
 * its own verifier refuted it as a defect measure (C18):
 *   - it counts COMMENTS (48 of the 429) — the census "improves" when prose is deleted;
 *   - it counts NON-COLOURS: `ul#dd1` id selectors, multi-line gradient stops;
 *   - it counts HTML ENTITIES on the JS side (13 of the raw 120), and issue references
 *     (`see ckeditor5#1341`, `#7429`) which are hex-shaped and mean nothing;
 *   - it MISSES `%23` inside `data:` URIs, every `rgb()`/`hsl()` call and every named
 *     colour, so it is not even a complete count of its own subject;
 *   - it can be "improved" by re-spelling `#fff` as `white`.
 * A count of spellings is a spelling. This gate therefore measures over the COMPILED,
 * SERVED bytes (`buildOne()`, the build's own compiler, over `entrypoints()`, the
 * build's own corpus) where comments are gone, LESS `darken()`/`fade()` are already
 * evaluated to the colour that ships, and `@import`ed partials are resolved. A rename
 * of a variable, a file or a class changes nothing here; deleting a comment changes
 * nothing here.
 *
 * WHAT "DRIFT" MEANS — the seed's definition, reproduced by the gate itself.
 * A literal is DRIFT when it has, or should have, a token, decided mechanically:
 *   HAS_TOKEN   a bare literal in a paint position whose value, normalised to 8-bit
 *               RGBA, EQUALS a value some custom property declared on a global root of
 *               the same served document already carries (in any axis: light, dark,
 *               design). It is by construction swappable for that `var()` today with
 *               zero pixel change — and it is exactly the site that will NOT move on
 *               the next retune.
 *   STALE_FB    `var(--x, <literal>)` where `--x` IS declared on a root of the document
 *               and the literal is not among the values declared for it. The literal is
 *               documentation that lies: 27 sites still carry the `#7f7f7f`
 *               `--fg_muted` was, 6 the pre-2026-09-05 brand orange (S10).
 *   UNDECL_FB   `var(--x, <literal>)` where `--x` is declared NOWHERE in the document.
 *               The fallback is then the painted colour in EVERY axis — a light literal
 *               under dark — and the name promises a token that does not exist.
 * Everything else is NOT counted as drift: a fallback whose literal matches its token
 * (duplication, not divergence) and an UNMATCHED literal (no token carries that value —
 * the shadow alphas, the identity hues, the QR modules). They are still counted in the
 * outer budget below, so they cannot grow unseen either.
 *
 * THE OUTER BUDGET EXISTS BECAUSE THE INNER ONE HAS A HOLE. HAS_TOKEN is defined by
 * equality with a palette value, so a palette retune that moves a token AWAY from a
 * literal silently reclassifies that site as UNMATCHED — the drift becomes invisible at
 * the exact moment it becomes real. So the total number of literals in a paint position
 * (drift + coherent + unmatched) is banked too. A retune cannot move a site out of that
 * one, and a shrink in either bank must be recorded by lowering it.
 *
 * THE SEED, MEASURED ON THIS TREE 2026-09-06, and recomputed on every run — no number
 * below is read from a file, so the derivation IS the gate:
 *   corpus   43 served documents (`entrypoints()`, compiled by `buildOne()`), 6028 rules,
 *            271 root-declared colour tokens carrying 393 distinct values, 1071 colour
 *            literals in all positions — of which 700 are the palette declaring itself
 *            and 40 are grammar-exempt (url()/gradient/mask/filter);
 *   CSS      274 literals in a paint position = 27 HAS_TOKEN + 38 STALE_FB
 *            + 5 UNDECL_FB (drift: 119) + 71 coherent fallbacks + 141 unmatched;
 *   JS       775 files under client/ + tools/ minus lib/, 21 of them carrying a colour;
 *            74 literals in strings = 27 HAS_TOKEN + 6 STALE_FB + 0 UNDECL_FB (drift: 33)
 *            + 8 coherent + 33 unmatched.
 *   INCLUDES named colours (`white`, `black`, `green` — 16 CSS paint sites the audit's
 *            hex regex could not see), `rgb()`/`hsl()`/`rgba()` in every syntax, the
 *            fallback inside a NESTED `var(--a, var(--b, #fff))`, `@media print` rules,
 *            and `ui.css_var('--x', '#hex')` calls in JS.
 *   EXCLUDES comments (gone at compile time), selectors (so `ul#dd1` and `#f5` are not
 *            colours), everything inside `url()` (so `%23ff0000` in a data URI is not
 *            one either), HTML entities (`&#39;` is not hex-shaped), gradient stops,
 *            mask images and filters, the values of the palette's own `--x:`
 *            declarations, `color-mix()` (the browser computes it), `transparent` and
 *            `currentColor` (references, not colours), `client/**` under `lib/`
 *            (vendored), and a bare named colour in JS outside a `:` declaration —
 *            that rule drops 9 of the 12 bare-name matches on this tree: 7 are class
 *            names (`classList.add('white')`, `' green'`) and 2 are genuine paints
 *            passed as a bare argument (`style.backgroundColor = 'black'`,
 *            `.attr('stroke', 'white')`) which this leg therefore does not see.
 *
 * SHRINK-ONLY, BOTH WAYS. Each banked number is asserted EQUAL to the measurement:
 * growth is a regression, and a shrink that leaves the bank untouched is refused too —
 * a stale bank hides the progress and re-opens the room to regress into.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. Every corpus size is floored AT what it measures today. If someone
 * empties the entrypoint list, breaks the LESS compile, deletes the palette harvest or
 * narrows the JS glob, the classified counts all fall to zero — which a naive
 * shrink-only gate would report as an improvement. Here it is red: the document count,
 * the rule count, the harvested token count, the total literal count and the JS file
 * count all have floors, and the class partition must add up to the total.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE.
 *   - That any counted literal is a DEFECT. A budget is not a judgement: the QR timing
 *     colours, the colorpicker defaults and the d3 series palette are content, not
 *     chrome, and the audit's decision (clause 2.d) is that the honest instrument for
 *     those is a browser assertion that the widget's fills differ between a light and a
 *     dark render. They are inside the bank because a bank that excludes what is hard to
 *     judge is a bank you can hide in — not because each is wrong.
 *   - That the uncounted literals are FINE. UNMATCHED means "no token carries this
 *     value", not "this colour is correct"; a theme-blind slab painted in a colour the
 *     palette never had is judged by the theme-blind-surface law, not here.
 *   - Anything about legibility (`contrast_ratio_tripwire`), about a token being
 *     declared for every axis (`palette_axis_parity_tripwire`), or about which
 *     documents are served at all (`css_corpus_tripwire`, whose corpus this one reuses).
 *   - That a JS literal is ever painted. The JS leg reads STRING literals with a lexer
 *     approximation (comments stripped, template literals honoured); it cannot tell a
 *     colour assigned to `style.background` from one written into a canvas, and a regex
 *     literal containing a quote can shift its string boundaries. It is a budget over
 *     "colours spelled in shipped JS", nothing finer.
 *   - Numbers here do NOT reproduce the audit's, and must not be reconciled with them:
 *     the audit classified `var()` fallbacks against the three palette FILES, this gate
 *     against what the served DOCUMENT declares — so `tool_assistant`'s 35 names, which
 *     the files never declare in light but the sheet itself declares under
 *     `[data-theme="dark"]`, are STALE here and "undeclared" there.
 *
 * COST: compiles the 43 entrypoints (~1s) and reads the client/tools JS tree. DB-less,
 * network-less → hermetic tier.
