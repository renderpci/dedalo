/**
 * `shouldDeactivate` — the per-row decision extracted out of
 * `exportHierarchySyncActiveStatus` (plan §4.1.7).
 *
 * The sync action walks every ACTIVE hierarchy registry row and deactivates
 * the ones the thesaurus no longer marks active. Two skips carry the risk:
 *   - `target === <the People hierarchy>` exempts it. Drop the arm and
 *     pressing the button deactivates People on EVERY install.
 *   - `active_ts === '1'` skips rows already in sync. Drop it and each press
 *     writes a needless component save plus a time-machine row per hierarchy.
 *
 * The loop itself and `saveComponentData` are never driven from here: the
 * action writes real hierarchy registry records through the standard save
 * path. The decision is what has arms; the loop has none.

// Migrated 2026-08-19 (generic-`test`-TLD sweep). The tipos below are NOT a corpus
// binding: `rsc197` is a CONSTANT COMPILED INTO THE ENGINE (the People-hierarchy
// exemption in export_hierarchy.ts), so the gate must spell exactly the string the
// source holds. `rsc` ships in the seed, so — as in test_corpus_fixture.test.ts — the
// tipos are composed through `seed()` to keep the install-TLD census's token grammar
// (scripts/lib/tld_census.ts) from reading them as records this gate reads.
