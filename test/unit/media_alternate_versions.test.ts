/**
 * THE ALTERNATE-EXTENSION TWIN GATE (2026-08-07).
 *
 * `DEDALO_*_ALTERNATIVE_EXTENSIONS` was read by seven modules and written by
 * NONE: v6's `component_image::create_alternative_version` was never ported, so
 * the engine scanned for, indexed and advertised files nothing could produce.
 * That is *config read but never honoured* — the exact defect class this suite
 * exists to keep closed.
 *
 * WHAT A TWIN IS (processing.ts buildAlternateVersions owns the rule): a per-tier
 * COMPANION of that tier's normalized file — same picture, same tier, other
 * container. The invariant, in the direction the engine holds at ALL times,
 *
 *     exists(Q/<id>.<E>)  ⇒  exists(Q/<id>.<defaultExtension>)   for every derived Q
 *
 * — enforced by the reconciler AND by every path that REMOVES a companion (a
 * delete changes no master, so the reconciler never runs on it). The converse is
 * a reconciliation, not a disk state: a twin may legitimately be absent.
 *
 * and the source is always the MASTER, never the sibling jpg.
 *
 * THESE ASSERTIONS ARE ABOUT CONTENT AND ALPHA, not existence. The fixtures are
 * flat colours (which master does this file depict?) and a half-transparent
 * master (did the cut-out survive into the twin?), because "a file is there" is
 * precisely what the broken engine already satisfied.
 *
 * EVERY TEST HERE FAILS ON THE PRE-BUILDER TREE except A4/A5/A6, which are
 * DECISION PINS: they pass today by construction and are here so that the three
 * deliberate NON-builds (a twin with no companion is retired, masters never get
 * one, the thumb never gets one) cannot be quietly turned into builds later.
 * Each says so at its own describe block — they are not dead weight.
