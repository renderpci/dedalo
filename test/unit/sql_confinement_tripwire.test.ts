/**
 * SQL-CONFINEMENT TRIPWIRE — mechanical enforcement of the TIERED SQL rule
 * (DEC-09 / audit S2-18, S2-19; README.md "Hard rules").
 *
 * The old absolute ("all SQL lives behind src/core/db/") was dead as written:
 * the audit census found 76 files legitimately authoring SQL. Its enforceable
 * successor is tiered, and THIS file is the tripwire the old rule never had:
 *
 *   T1  Connection ownership: `new SQL(` exists ONLY in core/db/postgres.ts
 *       plus the two sanctioned separate pools (RAG pgvector DB, MariaDB
 *       diffusion target). Everything else uses the exported `sql` proxy /
 *       tx helpers — which is what makes parameterization and pool lifecycle
 *       structurally uniform.
 *   T2  matrix_* / dd_ontology DML lives in the src/core/db WRITER HOMES — one
 *       per table FAMILY, each pinned to its own family (matrix_write.ts: the
 *       record tables + matrix_updates; time_machine.ts: matrix_time_machine;
 *       dd_ontology.ts: dd_ontology*; db_assets.ts: the derived search stores).
 *       Every DML site anywhere else is an ENUMERATED shrink-only entry with
 *       its exact write count and a reason; the psql/runPsql channel (DML
 *       text, stdin SQL, `-f` restores) is enumerated the same way with its
 *       encoding guarantee; the counter tables are owned by
 *       matrix_counter_monotonic_tripwire (same corpus, stricter law) and
 *       carved out here BY NAME. Plus the P0-3 rule: outside matrix_write.ts
 *       no file pairs an UNLOCKED read of a matrix jsonb column with an UPDATE
 *       that binds a jsonb value into one (the lost-update shape).
 *       Interpolated targets are FAIL-CLOSED: `${x}` counts as a matrix table
 *       unless it resolves to a string literal (same file / one import hop).
 *       Matching is POSTGRES-SHAPED, not a spelling: verbs and unquoted
 *       identifiers fold (case), `ONLY` and a schema qualifier
 *       (`public.matrix_test`, `"public"."matrix_test"`) name the same
 *       table, MERGE INTO and a server-side `COPY … FROM` are DML verbs, and
 *       a statement split across literals (`'UPDATE ' + t`, `'UPDATE' + ' matrix_test SET …'`,
 *       `${verb} matrix_test SET …`) is a site on either half, and SQL
 *       comments (`-- …`, block) between verb and target are stripped from
 *       every literal before matching. Residual limit, stated: a statement
 *       assembled from parts none of which carries a verb next to its target
 *       (`['UPDATE', 'matrix_test', 'SET …'].join(' ')`, `sql.unsafe(buildQuery())`)
 *       is outside any literal scanner — the corpus has no such shape (grep).
 *   T3  dd_ontology reads through core/ontology accessors (resolver.ts et
 *       al.), enforced as a RATCHET: the set of files still querying
 *       dd_ontology directly may only SHRINK. New code must use the
 *       resolver shapes (getNode / getOrderedSubtree / getChildrenNodes /
 *       getPropertiesByTipo / findFirstDescendantTipoByModel).
 *   T4  Named subsystem-owned tables keep local SQL — one owning module per
 *       table family, listed below; referencing those tables anywhere else
 *       fails.
 *
 * HONESTY CONTRACT: every list below is exact-file. Adding a violation makes
 * this suite FAIL (verified by temporary-violation probe at introduction);
 * removing one leaves a stale allowlist entry, which is safe (ratchet down
 * opportunistically). If a file on a list is MOVED (e.g. the WS-C resolve/
 * re-homing), update the entry in the same change.

// T2 — matrix DML confinement: one writer per table family.

// DESIGN. "One writer" is per TABLE FAMILY inside src/core/db/, not one file
// for everything: moving the Time Machine, ontology and derived-store SQL into
// matrix_write.ts would buy no invariant (each family has its own column
// contract) and would erase the module boundaries the families exist for. Each
// home is PINNED to its family below, so a home cannot quietly become a second
// writer of another family's tables.
//
// COUNTER CARVE-OUT. matrix_counter / matrix_counter_dd (and the `${counterTable}`
// door) are censused TOTAL — same corpus — by matrix_counter_monotonic_tripwire
// under a stricter (GREATEST-shape) law that pins its own writer set; owning
// them twice would force every counter change to re-pin two gates. They are
// carved out here BY NAME, with the same textual rule that gate uses.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED TARGETS. `INSERT INTO ${x}` resolves `x` to a string literal
// (same-file `const x = '…'` or one import hop to an `export const`). A target
// that resolves to a non-matrix name is out of scope; one that does NOT resolve
// COUNTS AS MATRIX and must either be resolved or enumerated. The MariaDB
// diffusion target directory is out by construction (its own DBMS, T1-sanctioned
// pool): its `${escapeSqlIdentifier(…)}` targets are publication tables.
