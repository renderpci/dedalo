/**
 * THE UNFILTERED user_tools LIST BELONGS TO THE SUPERUSER ID ALONE
 * (audit 2026-08 OH1 finding 5, restored 2026-08-09).
 *
 * PHP's only unfiltered branch is `if ($user_id == DEDALO_SUPERUSER)` —
 * tools/tool_common/class.tool_common.php:1403. There is no admin FLAG in that
 * decision: a global admin whose profile does not grant a tool does not get it,
 * exactly like anyone else, at every door (the menu entry, the section button
 * bar, dd_tools_api, the tool dispatcher's Gate 4, the oh media-icons widget).
 *
 * The port opened `getUserTools` with `if (isGlobalAdmin) return
 * getSuperuserUserTools()`, so SIX of its seven call sites over-granted every
 * non-superuser global admin. Only menu.ts had been fixed, and only in
 * isolation — by passing a hardcoded `userId === SUPERUSER_ID` instead of the
 * caller's flag, which is why that door alone was correct.
 *
 * THIS GATE IS THE RULE, NOT ONE DOOR'S WIRING: it asserts the flag cannot
 * WIDEN the list whatever a caller passes, and that the identity alone decides.
 * The second parameter survives only so the remaining call sites still compile
 * while they are cleaned up; it is inert, and test 3 proves that dropping it is
 * a behaviour-free edit.
 *
 * Needs the DB (the registry + profile tables). Expectations are DERIVED, never
 * hardcoded, so the gate holds as the install's grants evolve.
