/**
 * TRIPWIRE — every ratchet refuses its own LAUNDERING (P2-18).
 *
 * The repo's generators exist so debt cannot grow unnoticed. Measured, debt
 * grew: the crap ratchet's frozen `functionsOverCap` went
 * 672 → 701 → 697 → 702 → 691 across its life — a NET +19 over-cap functions
 * and +1 over-cap file since the day it was created.
 *
 * Three separate holes made that possible, and they are one shape:
 *
 *  - `raisedEntries()` compared each file's MAXIMUM complexity plus "new
 *    over-cap file", and never `summary.functionsOverCap` — the exact case the
 *    census exists for, a new over-cap function hiding under a file already at
 *    its frozen max. Worse, the census leg's failure message named the FLAGLESS
 *    regeneration as the remedy, so the reflex path WAS the laundering path.
 *  - `scripts/ci/audit.ts` had no anti-laundering guard at all: `--update`
 *    overwrote `accepted` with whatever `bun audit` reported this minute, and
 *    the RED message hands the developer that exact command. A NEW advisory
 *    could be accepted by running the thing the failure told you to run.
 *  - `observer_shrink_budget.json` — the ceiling on how many observer locators
 *    an ops sweep may delete over HERITAGE RELATION DATA — had no shrink-only
 *    rule, and the only gate over it built its fixture FROM the limits, so it
 *    asserted a property of `>`: `{1e12, 1e12}` passed byte-identically.
 *
 * THE META-RULE, and why it is here rather than in each generator: a script
 * that writes a baseline must be able to REFUSE. The census is derived from
 * `scripts/` so a seventh generator cannot ship ungoverned.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF (GATE-20, GATE-22): refusing is not enough when the refusal
 * compares the wrong thing, or when the reason for overriding it lives where no
 * gate reads. Measured at HEAD before this half: the advisory refusal compared
 * COUNTS, so a swap (one advisory withdrawn, one new) laundered flaglessly; no
 * accepted advisory carried a reason; and nothing compared the crap baseline's
 * `summary` against anything outside the file, so a merge resolution could
 * raise it with no generator run and no reason. The legs below prove, on
 * CONSTRUCTED fixtures (positive controls) and on the COMMITTED artifacts:
 *  - `newlyAcceptedKeys` compares identities — a swap is a regression;
 *  - every accepted advisory carries a reason the ONE shared validator accepts,
 *    and the generator writes `--reason` INTO the entry;
 *  - the crap baseline carries an append-only `ledger`; `summary` must equal
 *    its last line and every growth line carries a validated reason. The
 *    reference is IN the artifact and not a git merge-base on purpose: the
 *    hermetic tier checks out shallow inside a container, so a git-reading
 *    gate would be vacuous exactly where it must run.
 *
 * THE THIRD ROUND (the reviewers' refutation of the second): the generator's
 * refusal is a DECISION, and the first cut of that decision was proved by
 * grepping the block that made it — measured, `&& false` on the condition
 * left the gate green. Both decisions are now pure exported functions
 * (`updateDecision`) proved here on their OUTCOMES. And both generators had
 * turned "I could not read the previous baseline" into "compare against
 * nothing": a merge-conflicted (unparseable) artifact DISABLED the refusal,
 * so resolving a conflict by running the fix command laundered everything.
 * Now: unparseable → refuse; absent → every entry is new → refuse without the
 * flag. Finally the crap ledger's first line is pinned in code
 * (`LEDGER_BIRTH`) so a truncated or rewritten opener cannot restart the
 * history at an unreasoned number, and `ledgerPrefixProblems` proves
 * append-only against a git reference where history exists.
 *
 * THE FOURTH ROUND: the READER was the unguarded seam. "Unparseable → refuse"
 * was proved only on a hand-built `{kind:'unparseable'}` — measured, the reader
 * mutated to return `absent` on a parse failure left both gates green while a
 * conflict-marker file was bootstrapped over with `--allow-regression`. Both
 * readers are now driven on a real conflict-marker file, and both generators
 * are run as subprocesses over a scratch `--baseline` (read BEFORE any network
 * or measurement) to prove the exit code, not the fixture. A raise-by-ONE
 * per-file fixture pins the tolerance (`value > before + 2` was green).
