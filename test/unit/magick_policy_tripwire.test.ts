/**
 * MAGICK-POLICY TRIPWIRE (audit MEDIA-01, DEC-12: every stated invariant has a
 * mechanical gate).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO REFUSE. The hardened `policy.xml` bounded WHAT
 * ImageMagick may parse (coders, delegates, `@`-indirection — MEDIA-02) and
 * nothing about HOW MUCH it may allocate, and the engine passed no `-limit`
 * anywhere: a repo-wide grep returned exactly one hit, a comment in `probe.ts`
 * NAMING the gap. A 40000x30000 solid-colour TIFF is a few MB on the wire, passes
 * the magic-byte sniff and the upload cap, and decodes to 14.4 GB RSS on the
 * AUTHENTICATED UPLOAD REQUEST PATH.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT HAS TWO HALVES AND BOTH ARE ASSERTED HERE:
 *
 *  1. THE SHIPPED POLICY declares a `domain="resource"` ceiling for each of the
 *     named resources — including `list-length`, the only one that bounds a
 *     HEADER read (`-ping` skips the pixels and still enumerates every scene:
 *     measured, a 4.6 MB GIF of 200000 1x1 frames cost the upload preview's own
 *     argv 26.3 s / 8.73 GB RSS with the other seven armed). It is the ceiling a process cannot raise above, and
 *     it is the ONLY half that reaches an ImageMagick this engine did not build —
 *     a delegate child, an operator's shell.
 *  2. EVERY ImageMagick SPAWN carries the install's operating limit as `-limit`
 *     argv (`magickResourceLimitArgs()`, from the DEDALO_MAGICK_LIMIT_* catalog
 *     keys). Census TOTAL over every `runBinary(` call site under
 *     `src/core/media/` — derived from the tree, never a hand list — with the
 *     non-ImageMagick binaries ENUMERATED, each carrying its reason.
 *  3. A DEPLOY ARTIFACT installs the same file at the system ImageMagick config
 *     path — UNCONDITIONALLY — so the ceiling is the container's law and not one
 *     caller's property. (An `if [ -d "$d" ]` guard made that install a silent
 *     no-op on any base image whose ImageMagick config path moved, with this gate
 *     and the build both green.)
 *  4. NO DELEGATE. The one process halves 1-2 could not reach was Ghostscript,
 *     forked BY ImageMagick to read a PDF: a delegate inherits neither the policy
 *     block nor the `-limit` argv, and it is not the process the request cap
 *     kills — measured, it reparents to PID 1 and runs on. So the policy DENIES
 *     the `gs` delegate, no ImageMagick recipe in this tree may ask for a PDF
 *     rasterization any more, and the PDF render is an ENGINE-OWNED gs spawn
 *     (`engine/ghostscript.ts`) that refuses an oversized page before it renders.
 *
 *  5. HOW MANY may run at once. Every converter spawn — `runIdentify` included,
 *     with no `-ping` exemption: that exemption was refuted by the scene
 *     measurement above — takes a permit from the process-wide pool, or is
 *     ENUMERATED with a reason. And no identify call site takes a SECOND one:
 *     a permit held while waiting for a permit deadlocks at concurrency 1.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, stated rather than hidden: this is SHAPE, not effect.
 * That an oversized image is refused rather than converted is
 * `magick_resource_limits_native.test.ts`; that the pool really bounds, that a
 * 200000-scene source is really refused in milliseconds through the real
 * `probeImageSource`, and that the shipped policy really ARMS inside a real
 * ImageMagick (a comment can disarm it invisibly — see the comment leg) are
 * `media_admission_native.test.ts`; that an oversized PDF PAGE is refused
 * with nothing rendered and no surviving child is `pdf_rasterizer_native.test.ts`.
 * Neither this nor those bound the HOST's share of a legitimate large conversion —
 * that is a cgroup, i.e. an ops decision (OPS-12).
