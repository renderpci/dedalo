/**
 * MEDIA JOB TARGET TRIPWIRE — every background job says what it is working on.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: a `mediaJobs.submit(...)` call either stamps a `target`
 * (JobTarget: the record/component/tier it will change) or is named in
 * EXEMPT_SUBMITTERS below with a reason.
 *
 * WHY IT IS MECHANICAL RATHER THAN A COMMENT (DEC-12 "tripwired or deleted"):
 * the whole media-job-visibility change rests on being able to ask "what is
 * running for this record?". A single untargeted submitter is invisible to
 * `jobsForRecord`, so the versions panel silently reverts to the empty-cell lie
 * for that one path — and nothing else fails. That is precisely the shape of a
 * regression a test must catch instead of an operator.
 *
 * The scan is deliberately dumb (a source scan, not a type check): the target is
 * OPTIONAL on JobRecord because the exempt jobs genuinely have none, so the
 * compiler cannot hold this line.
