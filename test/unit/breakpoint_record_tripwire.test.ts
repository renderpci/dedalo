/**
 * BREAKPOINT RECORD tripwire (DEC-12; CSS coherence audit 2026-09, clause 2.e —
 * findings M5 "nine `@media` literals bypass the scale / `@width_break_point_2` is
 * dead", M6 "five empty `@media` blocks + a duplicate condition", T1 "the absent
 * gate, not the compiler, is why literals appear").
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The responsive scale was never a record. Four aliases sat in
 * `layout/vars.less` with no statement of what any tier was FOR, no gate, and a
 * docs line (`css-architecture.md:126`, `:350`) that said "do not re-declare
 * breakpoints in component files" and enforced nothing. The two costs an unstated
 * record always charges both landed:
 *
 *   - NINE `@media` conditions wrote the number instead of the meaning — 1280,
 *     1100, 1024 ×3, 960, 520, `48rem`, `min-width: 2000` — across six sheets. Two
 *     of those sheets (`tool_sitebuilder`) import no vars at all, so the scale was
 *     not even in scope; one (`tool_import_dedalo_csv`) used the ALIAS three times
 *     and the literal once, in the same file. Nothing a user saw was wrong: every
 *     1024/960 literal happened to still coincide with its tier. That is precisely
 *     the failure mode a gate exists for — the day a tier moves, the literals stay
 *     put and the layout tears silently at one width.
 *   - `@width_break_point_2` (780px, "images minimum width") was declared at
 *     inception and referenced by ZERO rules for three years. The scale ADVERTISED
 *     four tiers and had three. A tier nobody uses is a lie in the record: the next
 *     author reads it as a supported width and writes a rule against a number the
 *     rest of the app has never branched on.
 *
 * And five `@media` blocks compiled to nothing at all (bodies commented out), one
 * of them the sole use of the hardcoded 1280px, plus two byte-identical
 * `@media` blocks in a row in `search.less` so the first could never apply.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ASSERTS — two instruments over two corpora, because neither alone is
 * honest (see "WHY BOTH" below):
 *
 *   1. SOURCE: no `@media` condition in the built `.less` corpus contains a raw
 *      length, every LESS variable a condition names is declared in THE record
 *      file, and no `.less` outside the record re-declares a record name (LESS is
 *      last-declaration-wins, so a component sheet writing
 *      `@width_break_point_0: 800px` after its `@import './vars'` silently moves
 *      the tier for that sheet while every condition still spells the record's
 *      name — an adversarial pass landed exactly that, green, before this leg).
 *   2. COMPILED: every width/height threshold in every `@media` condition of every
 *      SERVED sheet (all 43 entrypoints, compiled in memory by the real build
 *      pipeline) is a record value, or a record value + 1 (the `min-width`
 *      complement of a `max-width` tier, a real idiom at 2 sites). This is the
 *      outcome: whatever the source spelling — literal, interpolated
 *      `@{name}`, `unit(1024, px)`, `(@tier - 64)`, a shadowed name, a literal
 *      hidden behind a `url(http://…)` on the same line — the number that ships
 *      is judged against the record.
 *   3. Every tier the record declares is BRANCHED ON by at least one `@media`
 *      condition — the dead-`_2` check. A tier is a threshold; one that is only
 *      ever used as a plain width value (`.x { width: @tier }`) has still never
 *      been branched on and is dead by this gate's definition.
 *   4. The record's FLOOR (`@min_target_viewport`, the narrowest viewport the
 *      layout is intended to survive) is never used as a THRESHOLD. It is the
 *      number "does this work on a phone?" gets answered against, not a width to
 *      branch on, and a rule that branches on it would quietly redefine it.
 *   5. No `@media` block is empty after evaluation — every one contributes at
 *      least one emitted declaration to the CSS that ships. Variable declarations,
 *      detached rulesets and mixin DEFINITIONS inside the block do not count: all
 *      three sit in the evaluated tree as declarations and emit nothing.
 *
 * THE RECORD IS HARVESTED BY SHAPE, NOT BY NAME. `layout/vars.less` is 91 `@name:`
 * lines, 85 of them `var(--color_*)` aliases; the breakpoint record is exactly the
 * lines whose value is a bare LENGTH. So this gate reads "every length-valued
 * variable declared in the record file", never `@width_break_point_\d+`. Rename
 * every tier tomorrow and the gate still finds them, still counts their uses, and
 * still refuses a literal — which is the point: two of this project's own
 * tripwires were defeated by a rename, and a regex over the current prefix would
 * be a third. The compiled leg is name-blind by construction.
 *
 * WHY BOTH. LESS substitutes the variable during compilation, so
 * `@media (max-width: @width_break_point_0)` and `@media (max-width: 1024px)` are
 * the SAME bytes in `main.css`. The compiled leg therefore cannot tell a literal
 * that COINCIDES with a tier from the tier itself — the exact state the tree was
 * in for three years, where 1024 ×3 and 960 ×1 were literals nobody could see —
 * and it can never see the dead tier. Only the source leg can. But the source
 * leg is a scanner over LESS text, and a scanner models a finite set of
 * constructs: an adversarial pass (2026-09-06) defeated the first version of it
 * six different ways — a shadowing re-declaration, `@{name}` interpolation,
 * `(@tier - 64)` and `(@tier * 0.8)`, `unit(1024, px)` behind nested parens, and
 * a literal on the same line as a `url(http://…)` — every one of which compiled
 * to a served threshold outside the record with the gate green. Each is now
 * refused at source AND the compiled leg is the net under the scanner: a
 * construct the scanner does not model still has to produce a number, and the
 * number is judged. The same pass also greened the empty-block visitor with a
 * variable-only and a mixin-definition-only body, and the liveness check with a
 * tier used only as a plain width value; both are closed and both have a
 * positive control below. Assertion 5, by contrast, can ONLY be compiled — an
 * empty block leaves no trace in the bytes (LESS drops it), so the post-evaluation
 * AST is the only place that outcome is visible at all.
 *
 * THE CORPUS IS THE BUILD'S OWN. `allLessFiles()` and `entrypoints()` are imported
 * from `scripts/build_css.ts`: the set this gate judges is by construction the set
 * the build compiles and the client serves. A gate with its own glob drifts from
 * the tool the day a directory moves.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE.
 *   - That any tier DOES anything. A referenced tier may gate a rule that changes
 *     nothing visible; a phone tier may exist with no phone layout behind it (it
 *     does — `vars.less` says so in its own words). Only the viewport-matrix
 *     browser gate (clause 2.g) can judge a rendered width; this one judges the
 *     record's integrity.
 *   - That a served threshold which EQUALS a record value came from the record.
 *     The compiled leg accepts 1024px however it was written; only the source
 *     leg refuses the literal spelling, and the source leg is a scanner. A
 *     construct that both evades the scanner AND lands exactly on a record value
 *     (a shadowing declaration with the SAME value; arithmetic that happens to
 *     equal a tier) is green here. The shadow check closes the first; the second
 *     is refused at source by the "only a bare `1` beside a record variable"
 *     rule, but a maintainer who invents a fresh evasion that hits a tier exactly
 *     has produced drift this gate cannot distinguish from correctness.
 *   - Anything about the JS half of the scale. Five JS sites compare against
 *     `innerWidth`/`matchMedia` with hand-copied numbers (1024, 960, 800 ×3 — one
 *     under a comment claiming it "must match `@width_break_point_0`", over a value
 *     that matches no tier). Clause 2.e leg 3 covers them and is not implemented
 *     here.
 *   - Anything about a `.less` the build cannot see. The corpus is
 *     `allLessFiles()`, which skips `/lib/`, `vendor/` and `node_modules` —
 *     vendored sheets are not ours to gate. It is also blind to CSS injected from
 *     JS (`dd-modal`'s shadow sheet is a string literal in `dd-modal.js`), to
 *     `@import (css)` passthroughs, and to `@supports`/`@container` conditions.
 *   - That a partial nobody imports is clean. The compiled leg and assertion 5
 *     reach only what an entrypoint reaches; the source leg reads every `.less`.
 *   - That the record's VALUES are right. 600px for the phone tier and 360px for
 *     the floor are design decisions; nothing here judges a number, only that
 *     every number lives in one place and every place is alive.
 *   - That an `@media` block DOES something. Assertion 5 asks whether it emits a
 *     declaration, not whether that declaration changes anything (a rule that
 *     restates its parent's value passes).
 *   - That non-`@media` dead code is gone. 139 empty NON-media rulesets remain in
 *     the tree (audit M6); assertion 5 is scoped to `@media` because that is what
 *     clause 2.e claims. Widening it is a separate, larger deletion.
 *
 * COST: 190 file reads + 43 in-memory LESS compiles (~0.4 s), each compile
 * serving both the compiled leg and the empty-block visitor. DB-less,
 * network-less → hermetic tier.
