/**
 * TRIPWIRE — EVERY DOOR THAT CAN WRITE A dd128 COMPONENT CONSULTS THE OWN-RECORD LEVEL
 * RULE (P1-2, SEC-03), or is an ENUMERATED exemption with a written reason.
 *
 * `resolveOwnUserRecordPermission` forces level 1 on dd244 always, and on
 * dd1725/dd515/dd132/dd330 for a non-global-admin, so a user cannot hand themselves a
 * profile, the developer flag, a new username or a different section_id. Its own
 * docblock says missing the DOWNGRADE half is a privilege-escalation hole — and it was a
 * HELPER three doors remembered to call. Every other write door read the RAW matrix
 * level, so a principal holding level 2 on `(dd128, dd1725)` — the departmental
 * user-manager role the downgrade exists to neutralise — was refused by the human save
 * door and SUCCEEDED through `tool_propagate_component_data` and through MCP
 * `set_field`, whose helper took no `sectionId` at all.
 *
 * The rule is now part of the RESOLUTION (`getRecordComponentPermission`), and this gate
 * is what makes forgetting it VISIBLE rather than silent.
 *
 * THE CENSUS IS TOTAL BY DERIVATION, NOT BY HAND. The door set is derived at run time
 * from the callers of the record-write primitives across `src/` and the tools' `server/`
 * trees. A new caller that is not in the table below fails this gate — which is the
 * whole point: the previous shape of this invariant was a rule stated in a docblock,
 * and thirteen doors did not know about it.
 *
 * WHAT THE VERDICTS MEAN, and what is mechanically checked for each:
 *
 *   consults      — the file resolves a record-addressed component level through
 *                   `getRecordComponentPermission`. CHECKED: the symbol is present.
 *   delegates     — the file's dd128-reachable writes are authorized by THE WRITE
 *                   DOOR (security/write_door.ts — closure Step 3), which applies the
 *                   rule. CHECKED BY OUTCOME, never by spelling: the file is a key of
 *                   DD128_PROBED (test/helpers/authz_door_probes.ts), and the
 *                   authorization-door matrix (authz_door_matrix_native) drives every
 *                   door listed for it with a `(dd128, dd1725)` user-manager on their
 *                   OWN account and requires the refusal. An ENGINE (no principal of
 *                   its own) may claim it only through its callers, so its IMPORTER
 *                   SET is derived from the source on every run and must equal the
 *                   delegating doors named in DELEGATING_ENGINES — a new caller puts
 *                   the row back to red until it is named (and probed) or the row
 *                   returns to PENDING.
 *   engine        — a write PRIMITIVE. Its docblock states that authorization is the
 *                   caller's responsibility; putting the rule here would authorize
 *                   nothing (there is no principal) — the callers above are the doors.
 *   section-level — the door's gate carries no COMPONENT tipo (a create, a duplicate, a
 *                   whole-record delete, a batch with no single record). The
 *                   per-component rule has nothing to say about it and cannot be
 *                   consulted even in principle.
 *   system        — no principal at all: propagation, provisioning, installer,
 *                   fixtures, the update transform. These run as the engine, not as a
 *                   user; a permission rule would have no actor to judge.
 *   not-dd128     — the write target section is hard-bound to something that is not the
 *                   users section, so no dd128 component can be reached through it.
 *   self          — the write is the ACTOR'S OWN account, already proved by a
 *                   credential in this same call (a verified password, a one-time code).
 *   PENDING       — a door that CAN write a dd128 component and does NOT yet consult the
 *                   rule. Each row names the finding. CHECKED: the symbol is ABSENT, so
 *                   fixing one FAILS this gate and forces the row to move to `consults`
 *                   — a fix cannot land silently. The list is SHRINK-ONLY.
 *
 * PENDING IS NOT AN EXCUSE, IT IS A LEDGER. Every row in it is a real residual of
 * SEC-03, left open because the file is outside the change that wrote this gate; the
 * count is pinned so the set can only get smaller.

/**
 * A record-write primitive reaches the revocation seam in ONE of three ways, and which
 * one it is decides what this gate has to check of the primitive's CALLERS.
 *
 *   chokepoint — the primitive itself fires the reaction. `persistRecordKeys` and
 *                `persistRecordColumns` host it (record_write.ts, inside the one
 *                post-write hook afterRecordWrite, beside the save event and the RAG
 *                seam), `saveComponentData` funnels into them plus fires the same hook
 *                itself on the one atomic-insert branch that bypasses them, and
 *                `deletePortalLocator` persists its survivors through persistRecordKeys
 *                (P1-8, 2026-09-03 — it used to write with a direct updateMatrixKeyData
 *                and call invalidatePermissionsForWrite post-commit for itself). Nothing
 *                is asked of the caller: this is the point of moving the seam here.
 *                The obligation ledger's entries (persistRelationRemovalKeys,
 *                persistRestoredKeys, persistObserverMirrorKeys, persistAppendedKeyItems,
 *                persistRecordBirth — CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2) are the same class. Every 'chokepoint' verdict
 *                is MEASURED on the writer closure's call graph (reaches afterRecordWrite).
 *   callee     — a different function owns it, so its callers inherit the reach. No
 *                primitive is in this class today; the verdict stays defined so the
 *                next door that reaches the seam through a callee has a name for it.
 *   n/a        — the primitive cannot BE an account transition. A create addresses no
 *                existing account; a duplicate writes a NEW record and leaves the source
 *                untouched.
 *   caller     — the primitive holds no principal and no component tipo, so only the
 *                door can decide. The two record-DELETE primitives are the whole class:
 *                deleting a user record is SEC-08, and delete_record.ts cannot know it.
 *
 * Only the `caller` class needs a per-file verdict below.

// "A GATE WHOSE ONLY ASSERTION IS A SOURCE SUBSTRING IS NOT A GATE FOR AN

// census honest, but it cannot tell you that the refusal WORKS. So this block builds the
// audit's precondition — a real principal whose profile grants level 2 on
// `(dd128, dd1725)`, the departmental user-manager role the downgrade exists to
// neutralise — and DRIVES the SEC-03 offender, `tool_propagate_component_data`, at that
// principal's OWN user record. Before P1-2 this exact call succeeded and the human save
// door refused the same write.
//
// Generic `test` TLD (AGENTS.md): the situation is BUILT here — a scratch dd234 profile
// and a scratch dd128 user, inserted through the counter-allocating writer and swept in
// afterAll. dd128/dd234/dd774/dd1725 are seed-shipped and have no `test` twin.
