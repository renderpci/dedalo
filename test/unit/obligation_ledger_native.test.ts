/**
 * THE OBLIGATION LEDGER — every chokepoint write carries its own observer and
 * relation_search obligations (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2: CORE-1, CORE-2 residual).
 *
 * The finding (audit 2026-09-26): the post-write obligations that are NOT in
 * `afterRecordWrite` — the observer cascade (needs the BEFORE-image: a removed
 * locator's mirror must drop the record) and the `_hi` ancestor index — were
 * calls each door REMEMBERED. The time machine's whole-record doors
 * (`restoreSectionRow`, `restoreAbsentSectionRow`, the bulk revert's
 * `restoreDeletedRecord`) forgot the observer leg, so an undeleted referencer
 * is missing from every mirror it feeds until a reconcile; a restored term
 * brings its mirror slot back VERBATIM (a phantom referencer); and the observer
 * recompute itself writes an `_hi` mirror without its ancestor index, so a
 * broader-term search misses it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED — OUTCOMES on the lane suite DB, never spellings:
 *   1   restore over a live row: the restored value's mirror lists the record,
 *       the REPLACED value's mirror drops it (the before-image leg), a MIRROR
 *       history row is written, and relation_search equals a normal save's.
 *   1b  restore of a snapshot without the indexer key: the key AND its index
 *       go, and the mirror drops the record (before ∪ after, not after-only).
 *   2   true undelete through apply_value: the mirror lists the record again.
 *   2b  undelete of a deleted TERM: its mirror is the recompute truth, never
 *       the snapshot's phantom referencer.
 *   3   the bulk revert's cascade undelete: the mirror lists the record again.
 *   4   CORE-2: the observer recompute writes an `_hi` mirror WITH its
 *       ancestor index (literal chain), through the save and the reconcile;
 *       a dry run writes nothing; a dropped reference drops the index key.
 *       4b: a legacy mirror (value right, index missing) is re-indexed by the
 *       reconcile — and NOT by an interactive no-drift recompute, which never
 *       pays the chain walk under its row lock.
 *   5a  a write in a transaction that rolls back propagates nothing.
 *   5b  a write inside an ambient transaction propagates AFTER COMMIT, never
 *       inside it (B6: recomputes run on committed state, post-commit).
 *   5c  a savepoint rollback discards exactly its own obligations.
 *   5d  an obligation queued with no ambient transaction drains inline (the
 *       covered-slot recompute entry, called bare — a save always opens its own
 *       transaction, and 7a/7b reach the branch through create/duplicate).
 *   6   the interactive save still returns its same-record observer data.
 *   7a  a CREATE whose relation default targets an observed term is mirrored
 *       (the create's birth declaration); 7b a DUPLICATE is mirrored (the
 *       duplicate's); 7c a duplicate stores no `_hi` index for the covered
 *       mirror it does not copy (the birth-columns law).
 *   8   a record DELETE propagates its death — held through a relay → info
 *       observer, whose stored value names no locator the delete's inverse
 *       strip could clean instead.
 *   9   a whole-record REPLACE over a live term keeps the LIVE mirror inside
 *       the transaction (never empty, never the snapshot's phantom) and
 *       converges on truth after COMMIT — the live value planted to DIFFER from
 *       truth, so the convergence is measured, not the live value again.
 *   10  the bulk revert's SOFT-cascade restore of a wiped term: its source keys
 *       come back, its mirror is recomputed (never the snapshot's copy); 10b a
 *       mirror recomputed after the wipe is never judged a write since.
 *   11  a revert that undeleted a term and its referencer: the undelete is
 *       VERBATIM (the term's recompute does not stamp it), and reverting the
 *       revert deletes both — a mirror is neither a foreign value nor a link.
 *   10c a soft-cascade restore whose run owns the record's stamps: the
 *       covered-slot recompute leaves them too (the posture carries).
 *   10d a soft-cascade restore whose snapshot mirror is EMPTY while truth has a
 *       referencer: the whole-section recompute lists it (no key comes back to
 *       request it).
 *   11c a term and its referencer undeleted in ONE transaction: the verbatim
 *       mark is on the transaction's shared guard at ENQUEUE, so the
 *       referencer's drain (queued first) leaves the term's stamps; one write.
 *   11d a mirror host and its referencer undeleted in ONE transaction, the
 *       referencer first: its propagation recomputes the mirror with NO drift
 *       (no hop), and the host's covered-slot recompute still HOPS — a live
 *       observer of the mirror learns the host back.
 *   7d  a CREATE: an `_hi` default is indexed by its literal chain and a
 *       covered slot's dato_default is never stored (the birth-column law).
 *   12  a pure INSERT (the atomic-append entry): mirrored, history written,
 *       indexed exactly like the set_data twin — onto a held key and an empty one.
 *   13  the REMOVAL law at all three removal doors: a stale index planted on a
 *       NON-`_hi` relation key is re-derived by the portal delete, the record
 *       delete's inverse strip and the data wipe.
 *   14  apply_value of a mirror's history row: the restore lands, and the
 *       mirror converges on the recompute truth after COMMIT (the component
 *       restore requests the slot's recompute), never the phantom.
 *   14b the bulk revert of a run that wrote a MIRROR key converges on truth
 *       (A14b); 14c with the run owning the host's stamps, the recompute leaves
 *       them; 14d a mirror OBSERVED in turn (depth 2): a referencer that leaves
 *       drops out of its back-mirror (the recompute's hop carries what it
 *       dropped), and a restored mirror's past value is never propagated.
 *   14e a bulk revert of a COMPOSED unit whose main is a covered mirror with a
 *       dataframe slot: converges on truth, never propagated, the kept item
 *       keeps its frame (the composed write is the COMPONENT-RESTORE entry).
 *   4c  a DEGRADED-SEED legacy `_hi` mirror (drops withheld, index missing): the
 *       reconcile re-indexes the value as stored; a dry run writes nothing.
 *   16a the component restore of a covered slot on a VIRTUAL section that has a
 *       component of its own is recomputed; 16c one on a section that does not
 *       declare the slot at all is too (the entry queues exactly what it wrote);
 *   16b the whole-section recompute on that virtual section lists the real
 *       section's mirror, and the wipe empties the same slot (ONE census —
 *       section/record/declared_components.ts); 16d likewise a mirror declared
 *       under a NESTED section node (the census crosses nested sections).
 *   17  THE COVERED UNIT — a mirror and the frames that pair with its items
 *       (`id_key → id`) move together: 17a an undelete keeps every frame on
 *       its referencer (the snapshot unit stands, ids kept), never propagates
 *       the snapshot's phantom, and the recompute HOPS even when it writes
 *       nothing; 17b the soft-cascade restore likewise; 17c a replace keeps the
 *       LIVE unit (mirror and frames); 17d a duplicate stores neither, and
 *       re-mints no frame target for them; 17e a soft-cascade restore whose
 *       snapshot mirror lists a referencer that LEFT while the host was wiped
 *       never propagates it (the departed link's back-mirror stays empty).
 *   15a a hook call with no observer declaration is a typed refusal naming
 *       its door; 15b an obligation queued by a leaked continuation is refused,
 *       never dropped; 15c a registry rebuilt cold inside a transaction is
 *       warmed after COMMIT.
 *
 * ORACLES: relation_search is compared with what a normal saveComponentData of
 * the same value writes on a twin record; the recompute is compared with the
 * fixture's literal chain. Every record is created at runtime.
 *
 * SITUATION: the `zzot` observer term fixture (test/helpers/observer_term_seed.ts)
 * plus two own terms (9: 9→2→1, and 11: 11→2→1, the 2b victim), and the
 * `zzoh` `_hi`-observer fixture (test/helpers/observer_hi_seed.ts). Both are
 * dropped whole in afterAll with the residue asserted 0.
