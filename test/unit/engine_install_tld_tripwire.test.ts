/**
 * NO INSTALLATION'S TIPO IS AN ENGINE CONSTANT.
 *
 * `generic_tld_tripwire` holds this line for TESTS. It stops at `test/`, and the
 * same accident is worse one directory over: a tipo belonging to one
 * installation, compiled into `src/`, is not a gate that passes on one machine —
 * it is BEHAVIOUR that is correct on one machine. It does not fail anywhere
 * else, it just quietly resolves nothing.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-22, that had happened four times, in three distinct shapes,
 * and all four were DEFAULTS — the one place an install name hides in plain
 * sight, because the code around it reads perfectly generic:
 *
 *   - `MAIN_SECTION` defaulted to `oh1`, the oral-history install's section and
 *     the page every user lands on after login. Now empty: a login with no deep
 *     link opens the menu, which is a real state rather than a broken tipo.
 *   - `MENU_SKIP_TIPOS` defaulted to two more installs' menu nodes, in a key
 *     whose own documentation already showed the default as an empty array. Now
 *     empty, as documented.
 *   - a test fixture named after the `dmm` install wrote its record into
 *     `matrix`, the installation's table — moved to the generic `test` TLD.
 *   - the iconography ddo defaults `inner_relation` to `numisdata722`, inherited
 *     verbatim from PHP. It is the ONE survivor, and the baseline below says why.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The set of install-named tipo literals in `src/` may only SHRINK. Each
 * baseline entry carries WHY it is still there and what removing it costs; a
 * new one is refused, and a stale one is red, because a stale entry is how a
 * ratchet quietly stops ratcheting.
 *
 * SEED-SHIPPED TLDs ARE NOT INSTALL NAMES. `rsc`, `dd`, `hierarchy`, `ontology`,
 * `ontologytype` and `lg` ship with EVERY installation, so `rsc170` in engine
 * code is a reference to the shipped ontology, not to somebody's data. They are
 * excluded here — and only here: a TEST may still not name an `rsc` SECTION,
 * because section_ids collide, which is `generic_tld_tripwire`'s business.
 *
 * ── HONEST LIMITATIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - SOURCE TEXT, so a tipo built by concatenation (`${tld}1`) is invisible.
 *    That shape has its own history in the hierarchy family and its own gates
 *    (hierarchy_state_native, "foreign target sections").
 *  - Tipo LITERALS only. A per-install widget directory
 *    (`component_info/widgets/{numisdata,oh,dmm}/`) is a deliberate port layout,
 *    not a hardcode, and is not what this measures.
 *  - The TLD list is imported from the census, never re-typed: one source of
 *    truth, so an install added there is covered here the same day.
 *
 * HERMETIC: filesystem reads of tracked source. No DB, no network, no clock.
