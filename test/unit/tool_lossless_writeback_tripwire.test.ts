/**
 * TRIPWIRE — A TOOL ACTION THAT WRITES BACK OVER A STORED COMPONENT VALUE IS
 * EITHER LOSSLESS OR CONFIRMED (P0-12; CLI-14 + CLI-24, both S2 CONFIRMED).
 *
 * THE DEFECT CLASS. A tool reads a curated value, transforms it, and writes the
 * transform back. When the transform loses part of the value the curator is not asked
 * and is not told — the tool reports success. That is the worst class of defect this
 * system can have: the records are irreplaceable and the loss is silent. Two instances
 * were live until 2026-08-30:
 *
 *   CLI-14  tool_lang in-browser translation: `browser_transformer.js` SKIPS a block
 *           that fails and keeps translating (its own comment: "Skip this block —
 *           accumulated_text stays unchanged"), then posts a byte-identical `end` for a
 *           complete run and for one that lost half its paragraphs. The main thread
 *           painted "Translation completed" and SAVED the short text over the target
 *           language's existing — possibly human — translation, resolving {result:true}.
 *   CLI-24  tool_transcription "Rebuild paragraphs": the round-trip through
 *           `transcribers/lib/paragraphs.js` ran `.replace(/<[^>]*>/g,'')` over the
 *           stored value — deleting the archivist's emphasis, foreign-word marking and
 *           uncertain-reading formatting from the RICH-TEXT component — and re-escaped
 *           every `&`, so an entity outside escape_html's four compounded on every
 *           press (`&#39;` → `&amp;#39;` → `&amp;amp;#39;`). The docblock claimed the
 *           operation "cannot change a single word". There was no confirmation.
 *
 * WHY THEY SURVIVED: NOTHING GATED tools/**\/js BEHAVIOUR AT ALL. `biome.jsonc` excludes
 * `**\/tools\/**\/*\/js`, the client suite does not drive these tools, and the server
 * suite never imported them. This file is the first gate that does.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three behavioural legs and a DERIVED census:
 *
 *   1. the transcription round-trip really is markup-, entity- and idempotence-
 *      preserving, over several real-shaped transcript values (CLI-24);
 *   2. a translation run that loses ONE BLOCK saves nothing, reports no success and
 *      leaves the target component's stored value byte-unchanged (CLI-14);
 *   3. the one other census row that claims a LOSSLESS transform over a stored value —
 *      tool_tc's timecode offset — really only rewrites the marks.
 *
 *   4. THE CENSUS IS TOTAL BY DERIVATION, per (action, door, sites). SERVER doors are
 *      DERIVED, never listed: the `db/matrix_write.ts` DML primitives, the OFF-HOME
 *      psql writers (a declaration with a BINDING-resolved edge to `pg_exec.ts#runPsql`
 *      — named, aliased, namespace member or injected — and a matrix DML statement,
 *      past every chokepoint; held EQUAL to the by-name view on the tree), plus every
 *      declaration that reaches one of those seeds
 *      through IMPORT-RESOLVED references — the writer
 *      closure (test/helpers/matrix_writer_closure.ts; a missing cell prints its witness
 *      path) — taken wherever a `tools/<tool>/server/**` declaration (a `tool.apiActions`
 *      object split per action) references a member OUTSIDE its own tool. CLIENT doors
 *      are the three `component_common` write tokens over every `tools/**\/js/**` file in
 *      git's unfiltered view (a tool's own `lib/` helper included). Every
 *      derived (action, door) cell carries its OWN verdict, reason and site count: a new
 *      action, a new door on a known action, a new or vanished call site — each is red,
 *      in BOTH directions (a fix that keeps the door is caught by the PENDING tethers
 *      below). THE BYPASS RULE: a cell whose door reaches a seed on a path that avoids
 *      EVERY record-write chokepoint (RECORD_WRITE_CHOKEPOINTS in the helper — each
 *      checked to be a member that reaches afterRecordWrite; `bypassPath`) must be
 *      PENDING, lossless over a locked read, or carry a `bypass_reason` (equality pins:
 *      BYPASS_TOOL_CELLS, and RAW_TOOL_CELLS for the doors that ARE a seed). It is
 *      judged by PATH, not by the door: a raw write moved into a wrapper of any name,
 *      any number of declarations deep, is the same bypass. No corpus file — src engine or tool
 *      server — may load a module through a computed-specifier dynamic import beyond a
 *      named, reasoned, shrink-only exemption list. The analyser and the judges are run
 *      on injected inputs (positive controls), and the closure's binding-resolved
 *      primitive edges must EQUAL write_obligations' name-based census.
 *
 * THE VERDICTS (per CELL — there is no row-level verdict a new door could inherit; the
 * `Cell` union makes `tsc` refuse a verdict without its evidence), and what is
 * mechanically checked for each:
 *
 *   lossless        — a read-transform-write cycle whose transform preserves the stored
 *                     content. CHECKED: `proof` is one of the behavioural legs' REAL
 *                     titles (`LEGS`, typed and re-checked), or the cell declares
 *                     `readVerified`, so an unproven claim is visible as such;
 *                     `lockedRead` additionally requires the action's own unit to
 *                     REFERENCE readMatrixKeyForUpdate through a RESOLVED edge (a
 *                     namespace escape proves nothing) — edge PRESENCE, not
 *                     lock-before-write ordering nor same-transaction.
 *   confirmed       — the operator confirms before the write, with the loss NAMED.
 *                     CHECKED: `confirm(` appears in the action's own body.
 *   refuses         — the action refuses to write a degraded result rather than saving
 *                     it. CHECKED: `must_contain` is in the action's CODE (strings and
 *                     comments blanked, so a literal cannot vouch) — or, with `evidence`
 *                     (`file#decl`), in that declaration's code AND the action reaches it
 *                     through RESOLVED edges. The spelling alone is a reading judgment, so
 *                     every server `refuses` cell is also BEHAVIOUR-TETHERED — held EQUAL
 *                     to SERVER_REFUSES_TETHERS, each a WRITEBACK_TETHERS title that
 *                     tool_lossless_writeback_tethers_native.test.ts (DB tier) registers
 *                     and runs through the cell's door on a suite-DB record, with its
 *                     counterfactual — and the client one by LEG 2.
 *   operator-value  — NOT a write-back: the value written did not derive from the value
 *                     it replaces (a locator the curator just picked, an import mapping
 *                     the operator declared, a Time Machine version they chose). The rule
 *                     is about read-transform-write cycles and does not reach these.
 *   new-record      — the write lands on a record CREATED in the same call (a bulk-process
 *                     row, a preset, a portal's new media record). Nothing stored is
 *                     replaced.
 *   no-persist      — the door only sets the instance's in-memory value; persistence is a
 *                     separate, operator-driven save.
 *   not-a-component-write — the derivation's own false positive: the token is a `.save(`
 *                     on something that is not a component.
 *   derived-state   — the write is state the engine RE-DERIVES from something else (the
 *                     relation_search index, observer mirrors, the metadata twin,
 *                     files_info re-scanned under the row lock, ontology / hierarchy
 *                     rows); no curated value is transformed. A READING judgment, not an
 *                     executed check.
 *   PENDING         — a real write-back that is neither lossless, confirmed nor refusing.
 *                     Every cell names the item that `closes` it. CHECKED: a client cell's
 *                     body has NO `confirm(` (adding one FAILS this gate and forces the
 *                     cell to move); a server cell by its (action, door) key — a fix that
 *                     changes the door is red as a stale cell plus a missing one — AND by
 *                     a tether to a FACT of its defect (SERVER_PENDING_TETHERS, total over
 *                     the server PENDING cells), so an in-place fix is red too: the
 *                     translation cells by a behaviour test (the WHOLE translateAndWrite
 *                     path on a scratch suite-DB record, in the DB-tier tethers file).
 *                     (updateCache's raw media write, the TOOLS-5 cell tethered by its
 *                     own resolved references, closed with CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2: it writes
 *                     through the locked media-key transform now.) SHRINK-ONLY, counted
 *                     per cell.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT PROVE — stated because an unstated gap reads as coverage:
 *   - it does not prove the two fixed tools are lossless for EVERY input. The
 *     transcription round-trip is proved for the well-formed shapes listed below;
 *     unbalanced markup is REPAIRED, not reproduced, and a fragment with markup but no
 *     words is still dropped — which is why the action's verdict is `confirmed`, not
 *     `lossless`;
 *   - the translation leg drives the REAL `translate_component_browser` through the REAL
 *     worker protocol, but `markdown_utils.js` needs a DOM (`DOMParser`) that Bun has
 *     not, so its three functions are replaced by identity in this run. The leg is about
 *     the save/refusal decision on `end`, not about markdown conversion;
 *   - the verdicts other than `confirmed`, `refuses` and the proved `lossless` ones are
 *     READ, not executed. The derivation is what makes forgetting an action impossible;
 *     the reason is what makes a wrong verdict a reviewable claim;
 *   - the relation link/unlink doors (P0-11, CLI-02/CLI-03) are a different write and are
 *     not this rule's subject;
 *   - the closure's binding is LEXICAL and scope-approximate: a local variable that
 *     shadows a same-file top-level name is taken for it, a column-0 statement is taken
 *     for module scope, and a key/value split is read off the source, not a parse tree;
 *   - a file OUTSIDE the corpus is not followed: a relative import — static, or a
 *     LITERAL dynamic `import('x')` in any form — may leave it only to a named target
 *     class (OUT_OF_CORPUS_TARGETS — test/, the migration runner, JSON, a tool's client JS
 *     the client leg scans, an IMPORT-FREE tools .js leaf); an unresolvable export
 *     reference is red;
 *   - `this.x()` and property-object dispatch — a registry indexed by name, a callback
 *     handed to a non-writer — are unseen: a write reached only that way has no cell;
 *   - a computed-specifier `import(spec)` is not followed: the exempted sites
 *     (UNRESOLVED_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_EXEMPT) truncate the closure there, by stated reason;
 *     a namespace escaping as a value is OVER-approximated (every export reached) —
 *     enough for a CELL, never for `refuses` evidence nor a `lockedRead` claim (both
 *     read RESOLVED edges only). A local HOLDING a value-position import (`const m =
 *     deps ?? (await import(x))`) is bound, so its `m.member` calls count per site; a
 *     namespace handed on whole counts its OCCURRENCES, not the receiver's calls;
 *   - the seeds are the `matrix_write.ts` primitives and the off-home PSQL writers (a
 *     tool-server seed carries a SELF cell — nothing to cross): raw DML on the POOL
 *     outside matrix_write (a `sql\`` UPDATE in an engine — T2.a's allowlist), a
 *     statement built in one declaration and run through psql by another, a
 *     whole-database `psql -f` restore, and a psql child spawned DIRECTLY
 *     (`Bun.spawn(['psql', …])` — ontology/data_io.ts#runCopyExport,
 *     scripts/test_db_setup.ts#psql) instead of through runPsql are not seeds, so a
 *     tool reaching only such a site has no cell;
 *   - the chokepoint list is DECLARED (with reasons) and checked only for membership
 *     and for reaching afterRecordWrite — not for WHAT it guarantees. A chokepoint unit
 *     is cut WHOLE: its own internal writes (the relation_search index, the dataframe
 *     slot strip inside saveComponentData) and any raw branch beside its hook are
 *     write_obligations' subject, not this rule's. The bypass walk is over-approximated
 *     (escape edges included — the strict direction), and a bypass is judged per DOOR:
 *     `bypass_reason` states why the WRITER the path lands on may skip the chokepoint,
 *     a READING judgment like every non-executed verdict;
 *   - a `lossless` cell over a chokepoint read-modify-write is not lock-checked — only a
 *     `lockedRead` claim is, and only as edge presence (the lock may sit in another
 *     branch or transaction than the write);
 *   - the client side covers only the three `component_common` tokens.
