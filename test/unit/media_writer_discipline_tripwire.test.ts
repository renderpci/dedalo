/**
 * MEDIA WRITER DISCIPLINE TRIPWIRE (DEC-12) — 2026-08-04, the layered-TIFF import.
 *
 * A media derivative is produced by exactly ONE shape: an atomic writer builds it
 * under a unique temp sibling, a single runner proves the tool really wrote ONE
 * file, and the temp is renamed into place. Every hand-rolled variant of that
 * shape is what shipped the 2026-08-04 defect, and invariants 1-6 below are its
 * measured causes; invariant 7 (2026-08-09) is the audit-2026-08 B2 class, which
 * is the same law one level down — a tool that was KILLED wrote nothing usable,
 * whatever its exit code says:
 *
 *  1. NO `renameSync(` OUTSIDE `src/core/media/atomic.ts`. `processing.ts` and
 *     `tools/rotation.ts` each open-coded produce-then-rename with no cleanup,
 *     so when ImageMagick wrote `<stem>-0.jpg`/`-1.jpg` instead of `<stem>.jpg`
 *     the rename threw ENOENT, the sequence files stayed on disk forever (six
 *     orphans measured under `image/thumb/440000/`), and the ingest died AFTER
 *     the staged original had already been moved irreversibly. Only the atomic
 *     writer has the `finally` that removes the temp and sweeps the siblings.
 *  2. NO AD-HOC TEMP NAMING (`.tmp.${…}` / `.rot.${…}` / `.crop.${…}`) outside
 *     that writer. `tools/rotation.ts` used `${path}.rot.${process.pid}`, which
 *     is wrong TWICE: it drops the extension, so ImageMagick infers the SOURCE
 *     format and writes e.g. TIFF bytes into a `.jpg` tier; and a bare pid is
 *     not unique per call, so two concurrent rotations of the same file share a
 *     temp. `tempSibling` puts the unique token BEFORE the extension and adds a
 *     uuid for exactly these two reasons.
 *  3. EXACTLY ONE `runBinary(` WRITE SITE in `engine/imagemagick.ts`, inside
 *     `runMagickTo`. `runMagickTo` is the output CONTRACT (exists, non-empty,
 *     and holds exactly one scene) plus the hardened `MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH`
 *     policy. Before this change `cropImage` spawned magick directly — so it ran
 *     unhardened AND could report success having written nothing, which is the
 *     failure class no stderr check can see (measured: exit 0, empty stderr).
 *  5. EVERY ImageMagick PROCESS CARRIES THE HARDENED POLICY, reads included.
 *     `identify` is spawned only by `runIdentify` in `engine/binaries.ts`, which
 *     passes the same `magickPolicyEnv()`. ImageMagick chooses its coder from the
 *     file's CONTENT: `identify -ping` on a `.png` holding PostScript selects the
 *     PS coder (measured: reports `PS`, exit 0 unpoliced; refused with "not
 *     allowed by the security policy 'PS'" under the policy), and the staged-upload
 *     thumbnail probes RAW UPLOADED BYTES on the request path. A read spawned
 *     bare is the CVE-2018-16509 class re-opened.
 *  6. EVERY RUNNER CALL SITS INSIDE AN ATOMIC PRODUCER. `buildThumb` /
 *     `convertImage` / `rotateImage` / `cropImage` must be called from inside a
 *     `writeAtomically`/`writeAtomicallySync` callback, never handed the FINAL
 *     path. That is the shape `ingest/staged_thumbnail.ts` had — no temp, no
 *     rename, nothing for invariants 1-2 to see — and it returned a
 *     `thumbnail_url` for a file that never existed, leaving `<stem>-N.jpg`
 *     orphans in a live media dir with nothing to sweep them.
 *  4. NO `[0]` SCENE-SELECTOR CONCATENATION outside `engine/scene.ts`.
 *     Callers declare `selection: 'representative' | 'composite'`; `sceneToken`
 *     is the ONE place that turns that into `SOURCE[0]`. `processing.ts` used to
 *     paste `[0]` onto two source paths inline, which is how the pdf/cover gears
 *     were safe while every image gear was not — the incoherence that hid the
 *     bug for as long as it hid. It binds the PROBE as well: `probeMetaChannels`
 *     asks ImageMagick about ONE image and the convert then masks ONE image, so a
 *     divergence there would decide on one image's channels and apply the answer
 *     to another's.
 *  7. NO RUNNER MAY IGNORE THE SPAWN OUTCOME, AND A KILL IS NEVER AN EXCUSE
 *     (audit 2026-08 B2, gate added 2026-08-09, CORRECTED the same day). A command
 *     killed by a signal or a timeout DID NOT SUCCEED, and `SpawnResult.ok` is the
 *     only truth about it — `exitCode` is not, because bun's `await child.exited`
 *     resolves 128+n (137 for SIGKILL) and reads as an ordinary exit code.
 *     Measured: every ffmpeg runner asked `exitCode !== 0 && !timedOut`, so the
 *     10-minute cap was the EXCUSE that skipped the failure branch and the
 *     partial, moov-less temp was renamed over the master derivative while the job
 *     reported 'done'.
 *
 *     The first fix banned that ONE textual shape. The second widening was worse
 *     than narrow, it was WRONG: it counted the mere MENTION of `.timedOut` or
 *     `.signal` as "consulting", so `if (r.exitCode !== 0 && !r.timedOut) throw`
 *     — the measured blocker verbatim — was reported COMPLIANT by the gate written
 *     to catch it, and its self-test probed a hand-narrowed regex instead of the
 *     constant, which is what hid that. The law has two halves and both are gated
 *     here, on the real constants:
 *
 *       7a. Every declaration in the scanned tree that calls a runner (`runBinary`
 *           / `runIdentify` / `runProducer`) must CONSULT the outcome or DELEGATE
 *           it by returning the `SpawnResult` to a caller that does. Consulting
 *           means the SINGLE TRUTH (`assertSpawnOk(…)`, `result.ok`, a destructured
 *           `ok`) or a branch in which A KILL TRIGGERS THE FAILURE PATH
 *           (`result.signal !== null`, `if (result.timedOut)`). `.exitCode` alone
 *           is exactly the defect and is not consulting.
 *       7b. NO declaration anywhere in the scanned tree may NEGATE the kill fact —
 *           `!r.timedOut`, `!r.signal`, `r.timedOut === false`, `r.signal === null`.
 *           That shape can only ever move a killed child TOWARDS a success path,
 *           which is B2 itself. It has NO exemption list, because there is no
 *           media operation for which "it was killed" is a reason to continue.
 *
 *     Why 7a admits a kill-triggered branch and not only `.ok`: a runner may
 *     deliberately tolerate a NON-ZERO EXIT (`runMagickTo` keeps ImageMagick's
 *     TIFF-tag warnings as a `console.warn` because the file it wrote is sound),
 *     so demanding `.ok` there would ban a correct behaviour the oracle had — an
 *     over-strict whitelist is its own silent narrowing. What may never be
 *     tolerated is the KILL, and 7b is what makes that non-negotiable.
 *
 *     Read-only probes are exempt from 7a BY NAME — the one documented degradation
 *     (`engine/spawn.ts`: a probe may answer 'unknown', but it may never claim an
 *     output exists) — and the remaining file-producing offenders are a
 *     shrink-only ratchet, not an exemption. Nothing is exempt from 7b.
 *
 * TECHNIQUE: a source scan over `src/core/media/**` plus `src/ai/rag/image_source.ts`
 * (the one media writer outside that tree), comments STRIPPED first so the prose
 * explaining an anti-pattern — including this header — is never a false positive.
 * Exemptions are NAMED, each carrying a reason the gate itself asserts is
 * substantive, and each self-tested for staleness: an entry whose file no longer
 * matches must be deleted, or the gate looks stricter than it is.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this proves the SHAPE of every write site, not that a given
 * derivative is correct. Correctness is `media_processing` / `media_atomic` /
 * `media_probe`; this gate is what stops the shape drifting back.
 *
