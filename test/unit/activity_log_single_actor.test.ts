/**
 * The SINGLE-ACTOR invariant of the dd542 activity log (WC-056).
 *
 * The Who search no longer emits jsonb containment; it emits an equality on
 * `relation->'dd543'->0->>'section_id'` / `->>'section_tipo'`, because that is
 * the only shape an index can serve TOGETHER with the list's ("timestamp", id)
 * order — containment cost >300 s for a departed actor on the 32.9M-row mdcat
 * log, the expression 1.1–4.3 ms for every actor class
 * (activity_who_expression_search.test.ts carries the full table).
 *
 * Reading element 0 is exact only while a row carries exactly ONE actor
 * locator. That is not a hopeful assumption — it is how `logActivity` writes,
 * and this gate pins it at the WRITER so the search cannot silently start
 * missing rows if the shape ever changes. A second dd543 locator would be
 * invisible to Who search, and invisible is the dangerous failure: no error,
 * just absent audit rows.
 *
 * (dd545 What is written the same way and is NOT part of the rewrite — it keeps
 * containment, served by the restored `relation` GIN — so it is asserted here
 * only as the shape this file would have to revisit if What ever joins.)
 *
 * Scratch hygiene: writes go to a reserved high section_id range on the real
 * matrix_activity and are deleted in afterAll.
