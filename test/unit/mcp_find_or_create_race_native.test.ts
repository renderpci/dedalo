/**
 * dedalo_find_or_create — two concurrent calls with the same match create ONE record
 * (review-diff 2026-10-21, correctness S3).
 *
 * The defect: the exact-match search ran outside any lock and the create
 * transaction did not repeat it, so a second call that searched while the first
 * call's record was still uncommitted missed it and created a duplicate — the very
 * thing an entity-dedup primitive exists to prevent.
 *
 * Driven deterministically: the first call runs inside a transaction held OPEN
 * (lock_interleave), the second starts against it. Pinned: ONE record in the
 * section, the second call answers the first call's record with created:false
 * (it waited on the section's find-or-create lock, then found it), and the
 * record carries the match value exactly once.
 *
 * SCRATCH: `zzfoc` situation (section + input_text → matrix_test), swept by
 * dropSituation, zero residue asserted.
