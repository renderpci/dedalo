/**
 * THE TEST-VECTOR-DATABASE TRIPWIRE — the THIRD shared surface of "a test never
 * writes production data" (DEC-12; audit 2026-08-26 REMEDIATION P1-16),
 * 2026-08-30.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS GATE MAKES UNREACHABLE. Until 2026-08-30 the suite wrote into
 * the INSTALLATION's vector database. Measured on this machine, 2026-08-29/30:
 * `src/ai/rag/vector_store.ts` built its pool's database name as
 * `readEnv('DEDALO_RAG_DB_NAME') ?? readString('RAG_DB_NAME')`;
 * `DEDALO_RAG_DB_NAME` was undefined and `RAG_DB_NAME` resolves to
 * `dedalo7_rag` — a real installation semantic index — and NOTHING in
 * `test/preload/` repointed it. `ragSql` is a SEPARATE pool from the matrix
 * pool, so it sat outside BOTH laws the project already had: the matrix
 * database's `dedalo_test_marker` row with `assertTestDatabase()`, and the media
 * tree's `.dedalo_test_media` file with `assertTestMediaRoot()`. The failing
 * INSERT that `test/unit/rag_api|rag_ask|rag_pipeline` produced on a machine
 * with no sidecar was not only a missing-embedding symptom: it was the PROOF
 * that `bun test` reached `dedalo7_rag` and wrote there — partition DDL,
 * upserts, and `DELETE FROM rag_embeddings`.
 *
 * (The index is rebuildable, unlike heritage masters or matrix rows. That makes
 * the damage repairable; it never makes the write allowed. A
 * `DELETE FROM rag_embeddings WHERE section_tipo = …` against a curator's live
 * index is a silent, hours-long re-embed nobody asked for, and on this machine
 * the embedding sidecar is a local model — on an installation it can be a paid
 * API.)
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, in one line: `DEDALO_TEST_RAG_DB_NAME` BOTH repoints `ragSql`
 * and ARMS a refusal, and every WRITE door of the store asks the connected
 * database for its `dedalo_test_rag_marker` row before its first statement
 * (`src/ai/rag/test_rag_db.ts`; `vector_store.ts` `buildRagSqlOptions`). One key
 * does both halves, exactly as `DEDALO_TEST_MEDIA_ROOT` does for the media
 * tree — so a run cannot be armed at the installation's index, nor repointed
 * with the guard asleep.
 *
 * SIX RULES, each with an anti-vacuity probe:
 *
 *  1. THE WRITE-DOOR INVENTORY IS DERIVED, not enumerated. Every top-level
 *     CALLABLE of `vector_store.ts` — a `function` declaration, a bound
 *     function, an arrow, expression-bodied or not — whose body carries a write
 *     statement (DML/DDL text, a module SQL constant that is a write, a
 *     transaction, or the partition stored procedure — comments stripped) must
 *     call `assertTestRagDatabase(` BEFORE that statement, or carry a named
 *     reason in `EXEMPT_DOORS`. A stale exemption is a failure: a dead exemption
 *     widens the law silently. The census is COMPLETE on two axes: no write
 *     statement in the file may sit outside every span the parser cuts (a
 *     backstop that turns an unparsed syntax into a RED instead of a silent
 *     pass — the hole an arrow-shaped door walked through on 2026-08-30), and
 *     the pool does not escape from the ENGINE, since no source under `src/`,
 *     `tools/` or `scripts/` outside `vector_store.ts` imports `ragSql`. (Tests
 *     and preloads DO import it — this gate itself does — which is why the
 *     escape check is scoped to engine sources and not to the whole tree.)
 *  2. THE REFUSAL IS PROVED ON REAL DATABASES, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Pointed at a
 *     real UNMARKED database the guard refuses, names the door, says nothing was
 *     written, and is READ BACK to prove it wrote nothing; pointed at a real
 *     MARKED one it returns. The marked target is built by the real producer
 *     inside a matrix transaction that is ROLLED BACK, so no database keeps a
 *     table this gate made. The misrouted-restore refusal (a marker naming
 *     ANOTHER database) is proved the same way, and so are both arming states:
 *     unarmed the guard issues NO query at all (proved with a connection that
 *     throws if touched — the property that makes it safe to ship, because
 *     production indexing can never be refused by it), armed it refuses.
 *  3. THE MARKER LITERALS HAVE EXACTLY ONE DEFINITION. No file re-types
 *     `dedalo_test_rag_marker` or the purpose sentence; every consumer imports
 *     them. (This is the media gate's rule 3 from the other side: there the two
 *     necessary spellings are asserted equal; here a second spelling is not
 *     necessary at all, so any second spelling is the failure.)
 *  4. THE SEAM IS ACTUALLY ON IN THIS PROCESS, and the database it names is a
 *     marked one that is NOT the installation's: the guard is armed, the pool's
 *     own `current_database()` IS the seam's database, that database carries the
 *     marker, and a REAL write door completes against it. Plus: the key is a
 *     declared `test_seam` catalog key (not a stray env read), and the seam is
 *     read in the ONE place the database is decided, ahead of both operator
 *     spellings.
 *  5. ONE SETTER PER TIER. `src/` and `tools/` set the key NEVER — production
 *     must not be able to arm itself. Exactly one file under `test/preload/`
 *     sets it, `bunfig.toml` registers that same file, and the assignment sits
 *     behind no `if` and no early `return` (arm first, provision second — a
 *     preload that sometimes arms is a preload that leaves the installation's
 *     index reachable on the day it does not). Exactly one file under
 *     `scripts/` sets it, `scripts/test_db_setup.ts`. And there is ONE PRODUCER
 *     of the marker — `test/helpers/test_rag_database.ts`, the provisioner both
 *     tiers call: stamping a database "disposable" is provenance, claimable only
 *     by the code that just created it, and NO engine module may mint it.
 *  6. THE NAME IS DERIVED, NEVER ASSIGNED. Both tiers arm the seam from opposite
 *     sides of the database repoint, so both take the name from ONE derivation,
 *     `suiteRagDatabaseName(suiteDb)` — which refuses the installation's index
 *     by name (proved in BOTH directions, the vacuity that made the matrix
 *     twin's distinctness check useless for months) and gives each suite
 *     database, shard clones included, a vector database of its own.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS, stated because a gate that hides them is worse than no gate.
 *
 * (a) The doors' refusal is proved on the REAL guard against REAL databases,
 *     and each door's WIRING is proved by derivation (rule 1, including the
 *     order of the call). It is not proved by making each door itself refuse:
 *     the pool is module-level and frozen at import, so the only way to make a
 *     door see an unmarked database mid-run would be to REMOVE the marker from
 *     the vector database this process shares with whatever else is running —
 *     the one mutation that could poison a concurrent run. The media gate can
 *     point its doors at a temp directory; a pool cannot be pointed anywhere.
 *     What binds instead is stronger than a name check: rule 4 proves the pool
 *     is on the seam's database and a real door completes there, and rule 1
 *     proves every door asks first.
 * (b) It covers the doors of the STORE. A test file holding `ragSql` and
 *     issuing raw DDL of its own (several do — `test/unit/rag_store.test.ts`
 *     drops a partition) bypasses the marker by construction, because raw pool
 *     access is not a door. Those writes are covered by the OTHER half of the
 *     one key: armed means REPOINTED, so they land in the test vector database
 *     whether or not they ask. Rule 5 is what keeps that half true.
 *
 * Registered in engineering/TRIPWIRES.md + scripts/verify.ts.
