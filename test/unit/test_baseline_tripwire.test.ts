/**
 * TEST BASELINE ARTIFACTS — the schema gate over engineering/test_baseline/.
 *
 * WHY. The suite baseline used to be a failset text file diffed by eye, and
 * that measure had four verified holes (bun's default reporter names only
 * failures; three '(fail) (unnamed)' lines collapse under set-compare; no file
 * attribution; a deregistered test SHRINKS the failset and scores as a pass —
 * see the header of scripts/test_baseline.ts). The replacement is a per-test,
 * three-state, file-attributed record written by `bun run test:baseline`. This
 * gate makes those artifacts trustworthy: WHEN PRESENT they parse to the
 * declared schema, name only files that exist on disk, and the
 * FLAPPING/ORDER_SENSITIVE set carries the shrink-only ratchet's paper trail
 * (an entry newer than the seed campaign must have an accepted_growth reason).
 *
 * ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEMA. The validators live in
 * scripts/test_baseline.ts and are IMPORTED here — the generator validates its
 * own output with the same functions this gate runs, so the tool cannot write
 * an artifact its gate rejects, and a second drift-prone schema copy never
 * exists. (The script's runner is behind `import.meta.main`; importing it
 * executes nothing.)
 *
 * FRESH-CLONE BEHAVIOUR. Before any campaign has run the artifacts do not
 * exist, and this gate SKIPS LOUDLY — a console line naming the command that
 * produces them — never silently: absence is a fact worth printing, not a
 * green worth trusting. A file that EXISTS but does not parse is red, always;
 * ENOENT is the only acquittal.
 *
 * MID-CAMPAIGN BEHAVIOUR (load-bearing): the campaign's child runs execute
 * THIS gate against the artifacts the campaign is writing. runs.json with
 * `complete: false` is therefore legal schema (the tool writes atomically —
 * temp + rename — so a torn read cannot happen), and this gate does NOT
 * require the three artifacts to agree on a commit: order_sensitive.json from
 * the prior campaign lawfully coexists with an in-flight runs.json.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, stated plainly: it validates STRUCTURE and the
 * ratchet's reason ledger, not truth — a deliberate delete-and-reseed of
 * order_sensitive.json resets first_seen and only the git diff of the artifact
 * shows it. The write-time refusal lives in the tool (--accept-growth); this
 * gate is the second lock, not the only one.
 *
 * HERMETIC: filesystem reads only. No DB, no network, no child process.
