/**
 * TRIPWIRE — the thesaurus TERM PICKER has one publisher, one mode writer and one
 * toolbar writer (2026-08-14, the relation `view: "tree"` picker landing).
 *
 * The picker is a capability assembled from four subsystems — the area read
 * (`src/core/area/read.ts`), the tree client (`ts_object`), the thesaurus list and the
 * relation family (`component_portal`) — and every defect it was built to close was a
 * DUPLICATION, not a missing feature. Before this landing the same pick was published
 * from two modules, the relation mode was wired inline from two tools, the portal's
 * toolbar had two writers whose order decided the result by accident, and the client
 * stamped a relation `type` the server owns. Each copy worked; the copies DISAGREED,
 * which is the failure a source scan can see and a runtime test cannot.
 *
 * The contract is defined ONCE in `engineering/AREA_SPEC.md` §5.7 (wire ledger:
 * `engineering/wire_contract/WC-2026-08-14-thesaurus-picker-caller-declared.md`) and is
 * enforced here:
 *
 *  1. ONE PUBLISHER — the pick channel literal (`link_terms_`) is named in exactly one
 *     module, `thesaurus_picker.js`, which publishes it. The RETIRED singular channel
 *     (`link_term_`, one term per event) appears in no code at all: it was renamed rather
 *     than re-used with an array payload precisely so that an un-migrated subscriber gets
 *     NOTHING (detectable) instead of silently running locator code over an array.
 *  2. THE MODE GRANT HAS ONE WRITER, and nobody MINTS it. `thesaurus_mode` is a SERVER
 *     answer derived from the caller the request declares (`rqo.source.caller`); the
 *     client may propagate that answer but may never assign a mode literal — a
 *     client-declared `'relation'` would open relation mode on any thesaurus with no
 *     caller that ever declared `view:'tree'`, the objection `read.ts` already makes
 *     about `source.model`. Every site that writes a `.thesaurus_mode` is CENSUSED with
 *     its role, so a new one is a decision and not an accident.
 *  3. `window.opener` stays inside the ONE publisher, within the picker path. Scoped on
 *     purpose: real non-picker uses exist (the time-machine window, the IRI opener
 *     nulling), so an unscoped rule would be red for reasons outside this subsystem and
 *     would get deleted. The out-of-scope uses are a SHRINK-ONLY census, so a new one is
 *     classified rather than absorbed.
 *  4. NO TOOL NAME in the shared picker path. The picker is generic — it is wired by
 *     tool_indexation, by tool_cataloging and by the in-page host alike — and the moment
 *     a core module tests for a tool's NAME the generic capability has forked. Comments
 *     are exempt (stripped before scanning): `area_thesaurus.js` and `ts_object.js`
 *     legitimately EXPLAIN which tool injects the linker, and a gate that fired on the
 *     prose explaining the rule is a gate somebody deletes.
 *  5. A VIEW'S TOOLBAR HAS ONE WRITER. `show_interface` is composed once per build from
 *     the `render_views` entry's DECLARED toolbar; the view module must not write it at
 *     render time — that is AFTER the composition, so which of the two won was
 *     last-writer-wins by accident. Mechanically: no view both declares a toolbar and
 *     writes one.
 *  6. THE RELATION TYPE IS NEVER STAMPED CLIENT-SIDE in the picker path. The old tree
 *     branch stamped `dd151`, but the descriptor default is dd151 for NONE of the models
 *     this capability generalises to (children dd48, parent dd47, index dd96, related
 *     dd89, model dd98, dataframe dd490) — and `type` is part of the server's dedup key,
 *     so a wrong stamp writes a row that will never dedup against the correct ones.
 *
 * NAMED EXEMPTION, with its reason — `client/dedalo/core/area_graph/js/area_graph.js` and
 * `render_area_graph.js` fold the same thesaurus fields as the tree client. They are
 * censused under rule 2 as DEAD CLIENT: the server refuses `area_graph` outright (an area
 * model with no behavior resolver is answered `read: area model '<model>' is not
 * supported`, `src/core/area/read.ts`), so that client cannot execute against this engine.
 * It is exempt because it is dead, not because the rule does not apply to it.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE SCANNING, through the shared string-literal-aware scanner
 * `test/helpers/strip_comments.ts` (precedent: `media_writer_discipline_tripwire`) — the
 * modules that implement these rules describe the retired shapes by name in their headers,
 * and a regex form of the stripper would eat the rest of a line after any `//` inside a
 * string literal, which hides ACCIDENTS and not just adversaries.
 *
 * EVERY RULE CARRIES A POSITIVE CONTROL, asserted against the SAME constant the gate runs
 * on — never a hand-narrowed copy. Without them a renamed module or a moved directory
 * makes every "this violation list is empty" assertion pass having scanned nothing.
 *
 * Honest limit: this proves WHERE the picker's decisions are made, not that they are
 * correct. What the server derives is `test/unit/area_picker_mode_native.test.ts`; what
 * the write path refuses is `test/unit/relation_insert_target_native.test.ts`; what the
 * browser renders is `bun run test:client`.
