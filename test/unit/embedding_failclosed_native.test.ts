/**
 * TRIPWIRE + BEHAVIOURAL GATE — EVERY EMBEDDING CALL SITE FAILS CLOSED (P1-14,
 * closing AIX-01 and AIX-02 of the 2026-08-26 deep audit).
 *
 * THE CONTRACT THIS GATE IS BUILT ON. `EmbeddingProvider.embed()` (and its
 * multimodal twins `embedImage` / `embedTextForImageSearch`) return EITHER
 * exactly `texts.length` vectors OR `[]`. The empty array is the DOCUMENTED
 * fail-closed answer, not an exception: SidecarEmbeddingProvider returns it on
 * every ordinary hiccup — a non-ok HTTP response, a body whose `embeddings` is
 * not an array, a row that is not all numbers, a fetch throw, an
 * AbortController timeout, or a batch whose length does not match the input
 * ("fail closed: retryable", embedding_provider.ts). "The sidecar is down
 * today" therefore arrives at every call site as an ordinary value, and it is
 * the CALL SITE that decides whether the engine refuses or invents an answer.
 *
 * THE DEFECT (retrieval.ts, until 2026-08-30). `const [queryEmbedding] = await
 * provider.embed([query])` yielded `undefined`; the `as number[]` cast erased
 * it; denseSearch's `JSON.stringify(queryEmbedding)` — `JSON.stringify(
 * undefined)` is the JS value `undefined` — bound SQL NULL into `$1::vector`.
 * That path DOES NOT ERROR: `1 - (embedding <=> NULL::vector)` is NULL for
 * every row, an ORDER BY over all-NULL orders nothing, and Reciprocal Rank
 * Fusion scores by POSITION and never reads the null score. ARBITRARY records
 * entered at the top dense ranks and were presented to a curator — or to an
 * agent that then WRITES — as the answer. Silent, plausible, wrong.
 *
 * TWO LEGS, because either alone is a gate that can be walked around:
 *
 *  1. BEHAVIOURAL. Every call site is DRIVEN with a provider that gives the
 *     documented fail-closed answer, and must produce a REFUSAL (a typed throw)
 *     or a documented retryable no-write — never a result set. Each site also
 *     gets a NEGATIVE CONTROL with a healthy provider: a refusal that fires
 *     always is not a guard, it is an outage, and only the control tells the
 *     two apart.
 *
 *  2. THE CENSUS. The call sites are DERIVED by scanning `src/` and
 *     `tools/*​/server/`, and each one must carry a row with a verdict and a
 *     MECHANICALLY CHECKED guard. This is what stops a fourth call site landing
 *     unguarded next year — the previous shape of this invariant was a sentence
 *     in a docblock, and two of the three sites did not know about it.
 *
 * THE PROVIDER IS PINNED, NEVER INHERITED — AND THE PIN IS PUT BACK. Reading
 * the machine's configured provider WAS the defect: a gate that embeds through
 * whatever happens to be listening on this host is green or red by accident.
 * The three older rag gates (rag_api, rag_ask, rag_pipeline) were fixed for it
 * in this same change set — each now sets DEDALO_RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER =
 * 'deterministic' and restores the prior value. That fix makes their embeddings
 * offline and reproducible; it does not exercise a FAILING provider at all,
 * which is why this file exists: the fail-closed behaviour is proved here
 * rather than assumed there.
 *
 * The pin is DEDALO_RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER/_ENDPOINT/_MODEL at a stub sidecar
 * this file serves itself, so the outcome is a property of the ENGINE. It is
 * set in beforeAll and RESTORED, key by key, in afterAll: `bun test` runs a
 * tier's files in ONE process, so an unrestored assignment at module scope is
 * not a local convenience, it is configuration handed to every file that runs
 * after this one.
 *
 * MUTATION-MEASURED 2026-08-30, re-measured on this revision (green: 28 pass /
 * 0 fail / 69 expect()). Reverting `assertQueryVector` in retrieval.ts to the
 * pre-fix destructure: 7 RED — all six refusal cases plus the census's
 * forbidden-shape check. Deleting the indexer's count check (indexer.ts): 2 RED
 * — the empty-answer behaviour plus the census's guard-present check. Both files
 * restored byte-exactly (sha256 verified before and after). Both legs therefore
 * have teeth on their own, which is the point of having two.
 *
 * NO INSTALLATION SURFACE IS REACHABLE, AND THIS FILE REPOINTS NOTHING TO GET
 * THERE. The vector store is already sealed by the suite seam: `test/preload/
 * rag_db.ts` sets DEDALO_TEST_RAG_DB_NAME unconditionally, which both repoints
 * `ragSql` (vector_store.ts `buildRagSqlOptions`) at the suite's own vector
 * database and arms the marker refusal on every write door (P1-16). This gate
 * inherits that and adds NOTHING of its own — an earlier revision repointed the
 * pool at a per-process database name that could not exist, and because
 * vector_store.ts builds its pool ONCE at import time, every later file in the
 * run inherited a dead pool (measured: this file + rag_ask.test.ts = 2 failures
 * that neither file has alone). A gate that breaks the suite to prove a point
 * is not a gate.
 *
 * So the imports below are static, and none of the refusal cases touches the
 * store at all: `assertQueryVector` throws BEFORE denseSearch is called. Only
 * the two negative controls reach the store, and what they assert is exactly
 * what a control may assert — that the embedding refusal did NOT fire — never
 * anything about what the suite's index happens to contain.
