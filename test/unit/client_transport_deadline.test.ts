/**
 * ATTEMPT-DEADLINE CONTRACT — client/dedalo/core/common/js/api_transport.js
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `fetch_api` runs a mid-attempt health probe: half way
 * through the per-attempt timeout it asks `/health` whether the server is alive,
 * because a slow answer from a working server is a BUSY server, not a dead one,
 * and aborting it would be wrong. The probe used to express that by calling
 * `clearTimeout(timeout_id)` on the attempt's only deadline — and never re-arming
 * it. So from the first successful probe the request had NO timeout at all: a
 * server that answered `/health` and then stalled left the promise pending for
 * the life of the page, with the "Awaiting for busy server.." toast already
 * auto-dismissed. A frozen widget, no error path, and only a caller-supplied
 * AbortSignal — which almost no caller passes — could still end it.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED (contract, not implementation):
 *  A. A busy server that then STALLS still ends the attempt. The probe extends
 *     the deadline; it never removes it. This is the defect above.
 *  B. The extension is ADDITIVE — the remaining budget PLUS the grace. Re-arming
 *     at the grace alone would SHORTEN the deadline for every caller whose
 *     timeout exceeds twice the grace: make_backup passes 3_600_000 ms for
 *     pg_dump, so a probe at the 30-minute mark would kill the backup seconds
 *     later instead of at the hour. A busy answer may only ever buy time.
 *  C. A DEAD server (no `/health` answer) keeps the plain, unextended deadline —
 *     the control that proves the probe is what distinguishes A and B, and that
 *     the extension is not simply always applied.
 *  D. A normal fast answer is untouched: it resolves its envelope and is never
 *     aborted by either timer.
 *  E. `on_wait(attempt, ms, 'busy')` reports the extension it actually granted,
 *     so the notice and the wait it describes expire together. The old code
 *     reported `delay + 3000` while granting an unbounded wait — the toast
 *     vanished while the request ran on forever.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. A and B would both pass against a build where the probe never
 * fires at all (they would just be measuring the plain deadline), so each one
 * asserts the 'busy' hook was actually called. Without that guard a broken
 * `check_health` would make this file green while testing nothing.
 *
 * HARNESS. `api_transport.js` is DOM-free and imports only `api_error.js`, so it
 * is imported REAL with no globals masked but `fetch`. The stub answers `/health`
 * per test and holds the API request open until the transport's own abort signal
 * fires, which is exactly the stalled-server shape. No DB, no server, no
 * credentials, no timers left running.
