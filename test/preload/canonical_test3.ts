/**
 * bun test preload — the canonical test3 playground is RE-SEEDED FROM CODE before
 * every run, so the suite stops depending on whatever the database happens to hold.
 *
 * WHY. The playground records (test3/1, /2, /27) are the fixture a large part of the
 * suite reads, and their VALUES are pinned inside oracle-captured goldens — e.g.
 * fixtures/info_widget_native/entries.golden.json hard-codes "input text content of
 * one", which is the live value of test3/1's test52. Nothing re-seeded them: a
 * developer who opened test3 record 1 in the UI and edited a field (exactly what a
 * playground invites) silently broke those gates, and the failure pointed at the
 * engine rather than at the edit. The data is the source of truth in CODE
 * (src/core/test_data/test3_canonical.json); the DB copy is a cache — so refresh the
 * cache before every run instead of trusting it.
 *
 * restoreCanonicalTest3() is surgical (seed.ts): it replaces the test3 rows —
 * canonical plus any strays a crashed run left behind — and leaves every other tipo,
 * the id sequence and the counters alone. It does NOT touch user data outside test3.
 *
 * MUST NOT BREAK A DB-LESS RUN. The hermetic CI tier (scripts/ci/hermetic.sh) runs
 * typecheck, lint and the DB-less tripwires on a bare runner with no Postgres at all.
 * A preload that throws there would take down all ~2000 tests, the pure ones included.
 * So a failure here WARNS and continues: the DB-dependent gates then fail on their own
 * terms, with their own messages, exactly as they did before this file existed. It is
 * loud, never silent — a swallowed restore that leaves stale data is the green-suite
 * trap this file exists to close.
 *
 * Escape hatch: DEDALO_TEST_SKIP_CANONICAL_RESTORE=true (for a run that deliberately
 * inspects drifted data — e.g. debugging the fixture itself).
