/**
 * S1-19 gate: authenticated get_dedalo_files differential vs the live PHP
 * oracle. This is the service-worker pre-cache manifest whose absence stalled
 * every production-posture login (the SW got HTTP 400 and never posted
 * 'finish').
 *
 * Compared byte-for-byte: the {type,url} entry shape (including the PHP
 * quirk that tools-branch css entries are typed 'js'), main.css pinned first,
 * and the FULL file SET. Normalizations (each justified, nothing else):
 *  - ORDER: PHP emits RecursiveDirectoryIterator (filesystem-dependent) order;
 *    TS emits sorted order. The SW only maps el.url into a Set, so order is
 *    not contractual beyond files[0] = main.css — compared as sets.
 *  - TOOL_COMMON URL: PHP serves the tool_common client machinery from
 *    tools/tool_common (/dedalo/tools/tool_common/…); the TS server relocated
 *    the TS client keeps it at client/dedalo/core/tools_common, served at
 *    /dedalo/core/tools_common/… (WC-006). Same files, TS-resolvable URL — PHP
 *    urls are mapped to the TS base before comparing.
 *  - DEDALO_VERSION: a deploy stamp (PHP constant vs the TS install literal) —
 *    asserted non-empty string on both sides, not byte-equal.
