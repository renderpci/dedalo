/**
 * Phase 5c gate: projects filter (per-record ACL) differential.
 *
 * `testmint1` is gated by its component_filter `testmint1013`; each record may
 * reference one or more projects (`dd153`). A non-admin principal must see
 * EXACTLY the records referencing one of THEIR projects — the same set a direct

 * everything.

// GENERIC-TLD MIGRATED 2026-08-19 (WC-2026-08-19-test-tld-replay-search-group).
// This gate never had a PHP oracle: it compares the TS search engine with a
// DIRECT SQL ground truth over the SAME rows, so migrating it is a matter of
// building the situation instead of borrowing an install's. It now does:
//  - the gated/virtual/second-gated sections and the non-admin USER come from
//    the committed test corpus (`ensureTestCorpus`, dropped after);
//  - the UNGATED case builds its own records, because NO corpus section is
//    ungated (measured 2026-08-19: every one resolves a component_filter,
//    thesaurus clones through the virtual→real fallback) — `test183` is a
//    generic `test` section with no component_filter, and this gate writes and
//    removes the two records it needs there;
//  - the project ids are READ from the non-admin's own user record instead of
//    being a hand-copied install constant.
// The scale-bound page assertions ('a 200-row page of a 15k section comes back
// full') are restated as what they were actually pinning: an unfiltered search
// returns the section's WHOLE record set, which is a stronger statement over a
// situation whose size the gate knows.
