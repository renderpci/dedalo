/**
 * SECTION_SPEC §7.1 gate: the list-mode SOURCE-PROPERTIES swap
 * (PHP resolve_source_properties, trait.request_config_utils.php:264-309).
 *
 * For a section in list mode WITHOUT its own source.request_config, the context
 * is built from its section_list child's properties — so the list view gets the
 * section_list's column css (e.g. the object section's per-column widths), NOT
 * the section's own edit-form .list_body grid. Getting this wrong misaligns
 * every list column in the client (the diagonal-cascade bug). Byte-parity vs
 * the frozen PHP oracle for the section `css` field in list mode.

/**
 * The frozen list-mode `css` for `tipo`, plus the proof that the frozen body

 *
 * THE SEAM (WC-2026-08-19-test-tld-replay): the RQO is written in test-TLD
 * terms and `unmapRqo` turns it back into the frozen request; `adoptTipoIdMap`
 * then proves the answered body IS the install-term one — a non-zero rewrite
 * count is the anti-vacuity floor. The single token it cannot map is the
 * install AREA node ABOVE the cloned section (the closure that built the
 * `test` TLD stops at the SECTION root, so the section entry's
 * `parent_grouper` has no twin); it is asserted EXACTLY and asserted to BE
 * that field. The token is never SPELLED here: a test file that names an
 * install tipo binds it.
 *
 * THE `css` BLOCK IS COMPARED UN-ADOPTED, and that is the honest comparison:
 * the clone copies a section_list's `css` VERBATIM (its keys are style
 * SELECTORS, not addresses — the clone rewrote the sibling `ddo_map` and left
 * these alone), so the cloned ontology serves the very same selector strings
 * the frozen body carries. Rewriting one side would manufacture a difference
 * that exists nowhere. The fact is asserted rather than assumed: whatever
 * install tokens the selector block carries, BOTH sides must carry the same
 * ones (`installTokensIn` equality below) — so a TS regression that started
 * emitting a different selector set reddens this gate.
