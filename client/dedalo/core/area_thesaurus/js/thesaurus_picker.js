/**
* THESAURUS_PICKER
* THE one definition of "this thesaurus picks terms for that component".
*
* Before this module the pick was published from TWO places
* (ts_object/js/render_ts_id_column.js and section/js/view_thesaurus_list_section.js)
* and wired from TWO more (tools/tool_indexation, tools/tool_cataloging), each with its
* own copy of the window resolution and its own idea of who may be picked. That fork is
* why a SEARCH RESULT could never be picked outside the indexation tool. This module
* replaces all four with one wiring call, one publisher and one term control.
*
* THE MODEL IS tool_indexation's, deliberately. The thesaurus is not a widget this
* module builds: it is an ordinary area_thesaurus INSTANCE, built and rendered by the
* standard element machinery, mounted inside whatever surface hosts it (the tool's left
* pane; the component's own tree view). This module never constructs an area, never owns
* a modal and never manages a lifecycle — everything that tried to do so was the cost of
* leaving that machinery, and it is gone.
*
* ONE STEP. A click on a selectable term publishes it immediately; the locator lands in
* the caller and the operator sees it there. There is no tray, no pending selection and
* no confirm: batching bought nothing (the server re-resolves the remaining capacity on
* every insert, so N sequential picks are capped exactly as a batch of N would be), and a
* pending selection only ever existed to replace the feedback an occluding modal took
* away. Picking several terms is several clicks.
*
* THE AUTHORITY LINE (do not blur it):
*  - The SERVER decides whether a read is a picker at all: `context[0].thesaurus_mode`
*    ('relation' | 'default') is derived from the caller declared in
*    `rqo.source.caller`, never from a client string. This module NEVER upgrades a
*    server 'default' to 'relation'.
*  - The SERVER decides how many terms may be linked: `context[0].picker` carries
*    `{selection_limit, remaining, targets}` — the resolved `properties.data_limit` of
*    the caller and its remaining capacity. This module NEVER re-derives that cap.
*  - The SERVER decides whether a given term may be linked, per node: root terms carry
*    `root_terms_selectable:[{section_tipo, section_id, selectable}]` on the area data
*    item, deeper nodes carry the same answer in the node's own `is_indexable` flag.
*    This module evaluates NO selectability predicate of its own; it renders the answer.
*  - The CALLER decides insert-versus-replace. A single-valued component (`data_limit:1`)
*    replaces its locator on a new pick; that belongs to the component, which owns its
*    value, not to the picker, which only reports what the operator chose.
*
* WHAT A NON-SELECTABLE NODE LOOKS LIKE: NO link control at all. The arrow means "this
* term can be linked", so it is drawn only where that is true — structural/grouping
* levels stay walkable and stay clean. A control that IS drawn may still be disabled and
* titled (already linked, or the caller is at capacity), but it is never a dead click.
*
* Exported functions:
*   attach_picker            — wire an area_thesaurus instance as a picker for a caller
*   publish_link_terms       — the ONE publisher of a pick
*   render_term_pick_control — the ONE builder of a term's link affordance
*   term_selectability       — read the server's per-node answer (never compute one)
*   get_picker               — resolve the picker from a ts_object/section instance
*   PICKER_LINK_CHANNEL_PREFIX — the event_manager channel prefix
*
* Contract with the server: engineering/AREA_SPEC.md §5 (picker contract).

*    the tool declares relation mode itself. This is the ONE client-side assignment of

* Three outcomes, and no fourth:
*   - not selectable / unknown→ NO control (returns null). The arrow means "linkable";
*                               drawing it everywhere would bury the terms that are.
*   - selectable + room       → an active control; one click links the term
*   - selectable, but already linked or the caller is at capacity
*                             → a disabled, titled control: the operator sees WHY,
*                               and a linked term stays visible as linked.
*
* @param {Object} options
*   @param {Object} options.picker - from attach_picker.
*   @param {Object} options.term - {section_tipo, section_id, label}
*   @param {boolean|null} [options.selectable] - the server's answer; when omitted it is
*     read with term_selectability from the term itself.
*   @param {HTMLElement} [options.parent] - append target.
* @returns {HTMLElement|null} The control node; null when the term is not selectable or
*                              the wiring is incomplete.
