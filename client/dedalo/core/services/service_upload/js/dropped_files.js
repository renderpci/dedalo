/**
* DROPPED_FILES
* Turns a browser `DataTransfer` (a drop or a paste) into a flat list of `File`
* objects, DESCENDING INTO DROPPED DIRECTORIES.
*
* This is the one genuinely hard piece of browser compatibility that the upload
* subsystem owns instead of delegating to a framework. Directory drop is a hard
* requirement: curators drop `scans/box1/` with hundreds of TIFFs, not files one
* by one. There is no standard, promise-shaped API for it — only the legacy
* `webkitGetAsEntry()` / `FileSystemDirectoryReader` pair, whose contract is
* full of traps that all fail SILENTLY (a partial ingest, never an error).
*
* THE THREE TRAPS THIS MODULE EXISTS TO NEUTRALISE
*
* 1. (!) `readEntries()` MUST BE CALLED REPEATEDLY UNTIL IT ANSWERS AN EMPTY
*        ARRAY. Browsers cap ONE call at an implementation-defined batch
*        (~100 entries in Chromium). A single call on a folder of 400 scans
*        returns 100 of them and NO error whatsoever: the curator sees a
*        successful ingest that is missing three quarters of the box. This is
*        the highest-value line of code in the file — see `read_all_entries`.
*
* 2. (!) `webkitGetAsEntry()` MUST BE CALLED SYNCHRONOUSLY, inside the drop
*        handler's own turn. The `DataTransferItemList` is neutered as soon as
*        the event handler returns, so the very common shape
*        `for (const item of items) { await something; item.webkitGetAsEntry() }`
*        yields null for every item after the first await — i.e. an empty drop.
*        `collect_roots` therefore does a purely SYNCHRONOUS first pass and the
*        traversal only starts once every root is already in hand.
*
* 3. (!) ONE UNREADABLE ENTRY MUST NOT SINK THE OTHERS, AND MUST NOT VANISH.
*        A permission error, a dangling symlink or a file deleted between the
*        drop and the read makes `entry.file()` / `readEntries()` invoke their
*        ERROR callback and nothing else. Swallowing it (what the reference
*        implementation does — it `console.log`s and returns) drops a file from
*        a heritage ingest with no trace. Every failure here is collected and
*        surfaced: per-failure through `options.on_error`, and in bulk on the
*        returned array's non-enumerable `errors` property.
*
* LIMITS (stated, never silent — AGENTS.md "never silently narrow scope"). Every
* one of them, when hit, pushes an error entry describing exactly what was cut:
*   - `max_depth`        32     directory levels below each dropped root.
*   - `max_files`        20000  files returned in total.
*   - `max_entries`      50000  directory entries examined in total.
*   - `max_read_calls`   2000   `readEntries()` calls for a SINGLE directory —
*                               a cycle guard for a reader that never empties.
*   - a PER-ROOT `Set` of already-visited directories, so a directory an engine
*     re-serves under one identity terminates instead of spinning.
*
* (!) THE VISITED SET IS PER DROPPED ROOT, AND KEYED ON THE FILESYSTEM.
* It used to be ONE set for the whole drop, keyed on `fullPath` alone. Chrome
* gives every dropped root `fullPath = '/' + name`, so dropping `boxA/scans` and
* `boxB/scans` together made the SECOND ROOT a "cycle": hundreds of scans were
* discarded whole, and the only trace was one line saying a single item could not
* be read. Scoping the set per root removes the collision by construction; the
* filesystem id in the key removes it again for any engine that hands two roots
* to one traversal.
* Stated honestly (AGENTS.md — never silently narrow scope): this guard is NOT
* what makes a genuine symlink loop terminate. No engine resolves the link, so
* `a/b → a` yields a strictly GROWING `fullPath` (`/a`, `/a/b`, `/a/b/a`, …) and
* no identity ever repeats. `max_depth` and `max_entries` are the real
* terminators, and both report what they cut.
*
* Main export:
* - `files_from_drop(data_transfer, options)` → `Promise<File[]>`
