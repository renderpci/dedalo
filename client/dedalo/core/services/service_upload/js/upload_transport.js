/**
* UPLOAD_TRANSPORT
* The wire core of the Dédalo upload path, extracted out of service_upload.js.
*
* This is the ONLY module in the client that constructs an XMLHttpRequest, and it
* is deliberately DOM-FREE: no event_manager, no get_label, no alert(), no DOM
* node, no CSS class. It speaks bytes and resolves objects; everything that a
* human sees is decided by the caller. That separation is what makes a
* multi-file queue possible: a queue cannot be built on top of a transport that
* blocks on alert() or that writes into one fixed progress bar.
*
* The only non-wire import is data_manager, because the chunked flow is NOT a
* single request — it is N multipart POSTs followed by ONE JSON RQO
* (dd_utils_api::join_chunked_files_uploaded) that assembles them server-side.
* Owning the join here is what lets `start()` resolve exactly once with the
* file_data of the FINAL assembled file; a caller that had to fire the join
* itself would have to reimplement the chunk bookkeeping.
*
* THE ONE LAW OF THIS MODULE: `start()` resolves exactly once on every terminal
* path and NEVER rejects. See create_transfer for why (defects D1/D2).
*
* Main exports:
* - `validate_file`          — pure, synchronous pre-flight check (no UI).
* - `create_connection_pool` — sliding-window concurrency semaphore.
* - `create_transfer`        — one file → one `{start, abort, status}` handle.
* - `join_chunked_files`     — the server-side assemble RQO (also used as the
*                              delegate of service_upload.prototype.join_chunked_files).

/**
* VALIDATE_FILE
* Pure, synchronous pre-flight validation of a file against the advertised
* client-side limits. It NEVER alerts, NEVER logs and NEVER throws — it returns
* a verdict and lets the caller decide how (or whether) to show it.
*
* `code` is the LABEL KEY, not a rendered string, precisely because the two
* callers want different presentations: the single-file service still blocks on
* alert() (legacy UX contract), while a multi-file queue must collect the
* verdicts and render them per row without ever blocking.
*
* (!) DEFECT D3 — FIXED HERE. The previous implementation did:
*         if (!allowed_extensions.includes(file_extension)) reject
*     with callers that pass `[]` (the import tools never assign the list).
*     `[].includes(x)` is ALWAYS false, so an empty list rejected EVERY file.
*     An absent or empty whitelist means "no whitelist configured" — i.e.
*     ALLOW ALL — never "whitelist of none". If this regresses, every upload
*     from a tool that does not configure allowed_extensions dies client-side
*     with an "invalid extension" alert and never reaches the network.
*     The real enforcement is server-side magic-byte sniffing
*     (src/core/media/engine/mime.ts sniffAndValidate); this list is advisory
*     UX only, so failing open here is safe.
*
* (!) A falsy or 0 `max_size_bytes` likewise means "no limit advertised", not
*     "maximum zero bytes". The server enforces its own cap in
*     parseUploadRequest (config.media.upload.maxSizeBytes).
*
* @param {Object} options
*   @param {File|Blob} options.file - The file to check (needs `name` and `size`).
*   @param {Array<string>} [options.allowed_extensions] - Lowercase extension
*     whitelist. Empty/absent = allow all.
*   @param {number} [options.max_size_bytes] - Size cap in bytes. Falsy = no cap.
* @returns {Object} `{valid:boolean, code:string|null, msg:string|null}` where
*   `code` is a get_label key ('invalid_extension' | 'filesize_is_too_big') and
*   `detail` is the DETAIL text meant to be appended to that resolved label
*   (keeping the legacy alert text byte-identical).

/**
* NEW_UPLOAD_ID
* Mints the identity of ONE transfer: an opaque token that every part of that
* file carries and that no other transfer shares.
*
* WHY: the receiver stages chunk parts under `.up_<upload_id>/<i>.part` and
* claims the final staged name atomically. Without an explicit id it derives one
* from `sha256(key_dir, RAW file name, total_chunks)` — which is already safe for
* a single transfer and already separates `María.jpg` from `Mar#a.jpg` (it hashes
* BEFORE sanitising). The residue that only an explicit id closes is TWO
* SIMULTANEOUS transfers of the same raw name into the same key_dir, which is
* unreachable with one file picker and perfectly reachable from a queue. So the
* fallback is not a reason to omit this — the queue is exactly the caller that
* breaks it.
*
* The server VALIDATES `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,64}$` and REFUSES anything else rather
* than sanitising it, so every branch below must emit only those characters.
*
* crypto.randomUUID() is unavailable outside a secure context (an http:// dev
* install is exactly that case), so falling back is not optional — an exception
* here would break every upload on plain http. getRandomValues has the same
* secure-context caveat in practice, hence the third tier; it is weaker but the
* id only needs to be unique among ONE user's concurrent uploads, not
* unguessable — it grants no authority, and the server scopes staging per user.

/**
* CREATE_TRANSFER
* Builds ONE upload handle for ONE file. Nothing happens until `start()`.
*
* THE SETTLEMENT LAW — `start()` resolves EXACTLY ONCE on EVERY terminal path
* (success, server refusal, transport error, abort, max-retries-exceeded) and
* NEVER rejects. Both halves matter:
*
* (!) DEFECT D1 — FIXED HERE. The legacy `upload()` returned
*     `new Promise(async function(resolve){…})` and called `resolve` ONLY from
*     the xhr "load" handler. The upload-"error" handler and the abort handler
*     published an event and returned. So on ANY transport failure the awaited
*     promise NEVER SETTLED: `await upload_file()` never returned, the caller's
*     spinner span stayed on screen forever, and no error was ever rendered.
*     Every exit below goes through `settle()`, which is the single writer of
*     the outer promise and is idempotent. If a new exit path is added without
*     calling settle(), the wedge comes back.
*
* (!) DEFECT D2 — FIXED HERE. The legacy `send_chunk` returned
*     `new Promise(function(resolve){` — only `resolve` was bound — yet called
*     `reject(...)` in three places (max retries exceeded, abort, non-2xx load).
*     All three were a ReferenceError at runtime, so the CHUNKED path had no
*     working failure mode at all: a rejected chunk threw inside a handler and
*     the transfer hung. This module never uses reject for a transfer outcome;
*     a failure is a RESOLVED `{ok:false, error:ApiError}` value, because a
*     rejection the caller cannot render is indistinguishable from a crash.
*
* Progress is BYTE-WEIGHTED: `sum(bytes_of_each_chunk_done) / total_bytes`. The
* legacy code averaged the per-chunk PERCENTAGES, which is only correct when all
* chunks are the same size — and the last chunk never is. On a 3-chunk transfer
* of 80/80/2 MB the old bar showed 66% when 98% of the bytes were gone.
* The per-chunk ratio (loaded/total of that REQUEST) is what gets weighted, not
* the raw `loaded`, because the request body also carries the multipart
* boundaries and the other form fields — weighting raw bytes would overshoot.
*
* @param {Object} options
*   @param {File} options.file - The file to send.
*   @param {string} [options.name] - Wire file name; defaults to `file.name`.
*   @param {string} options.key_dir - Server-side directory routing key.
*   @param {string|null} [options.tipo] - Ontology tipo of the owning component.
*   @param {number} [options.chunk_size_mb] - >0 = chunked, otherwise single-shot.
*   @param {Object} [options.pool] - Shared connection pool; a private unbounded
*     one is created when absent.
*   @param {number} [options.max_retry=3] - Retries per chunk on TRANSPORT error.
*   @param {Object} [options.callbacks] - All optional:
*     `on_start()`, `on_progress({loaded,total,percent})`,
*     `on_retry({chunk_index,attempt,max_retry})`,
*     `on_chunk({chunk_index,total_chunks})`,
*     `on_done(api_response)`, `on_error(api_response)` — the terminal pair, so a
*     renderer can repaint one queue row without holding the `start()` promise.
* @returns {Object} `{start():Promise<Object>, abort():void, status():string,
*   upload_id():string}` where status is
*   'idle'|'queued'|'running'|'done'|'error'|'aborted'.
*   `upload_id()` is this transfer's identity — the same token every part sends
*   as the `upload_id` multipart field, minted once at creation. Exposed for the
*   queue's cancel-and-sweep; see the note in abort().
*   'queued' is the window between `start()` and the first part the pool admits:
*   a transfer with no socket open yet is NOT uploading, and a queue that cannot
*   distinguish the two shows every pending row as "in progress".
