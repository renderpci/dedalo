/**
* DATA_MANAGER
* Central client-to-server request layer for Dédalo v7.
*
* Responsibilities:
* - Building and dispatching all API calls to the JSON endpoint
*   (`api/v1/json/`) with configurable HTTP options (method, mode, credentials).
* - Delegating the fetch itself to the shared, DOM-free transport
*   `api_transport.js` (`fetch_api`: read-once body, JSON parse, envelope
*   normalisation, retry keyed on `retryable` + `Retry-After`, per-attempt
*   timeout with the busy-server health probe). The same transport serves the
*   cache Worker and the Service Worker, so there is ONE request algorithm.
* - CSRF token management (SEC-008): reads the token from `page_globals.csrf_token`,
*   injects it as `X-Dedalo-Csrf-Token`, refreshes it from every response, and
*   performs a single transparent retry on CSRF rejection.
* - Short-circuit caching against the browser's IndexedDB (`cache_handler: {handler:'localdb'}`).
* - SSE / NDJSON streaming support via `request_stream` / `request_fetch_stream` /
*   `read_stream`.
* - Persisting UI state and cached lookups to IndexedDB through the
*   `*_local_db*` family of methods.
* - Convenience download helpers (`download_url`, `download_data`).
*
* ERROR CONTRACT (envelope v2, see api_error.js): `request` resolves the server
* envelope. On ANY failure — envelope `ok:false`, transport, unparseable body —
* the resolved object carries `error` = an `ApiError` (`request_failed(api_response)`
* is THE test), and the transport publishes `'api_error'` (the ApiError) on the
* event bus. The payload of a success is `response_data(api_response)`.
* A SUCCESS may also carry `notices[]` (non-fatal coded facts, ERRORS_SPEC §3):
* they are published once as `'api_notices'` and rendered by the page's
* `handle_api_notice` subscriber unless a caller reads them itself.
*
* IDEMPOTENCY CONTRACT (CLI-01 / P0-10, 2026-08-28 —
* WC-2026-08-28-idempotency-key): the retry loop above re-sends a POST the
* server may ALREADY be executing (the abort is client-side only; the engine
* has no request.signal handling, so an aborted attempt runs to completion and
* COMMITS). So every request this layer may resend is STAMPED: `execute_request`
* mints one `idempotency_key` per logical call and puts it in the body ONCE,
* before serialization, so all attempts of that call are byte-identical and the
* server replays the first answer instead of executing again. A request that
* CANNOT be stamped (a pre-serialized string body) is never resent more than
* once. Callers do not opt in and must not pass a key themselves — a key reused
* across two different operations is worse than no key at all.
*
* Main exports: `data_manager` (namespace object), `check_server_health`,
* `render_msg_to_inspector`, `download_url`, `download_data`.

/**
* REQUEST
* Central API call dispatcher. Serializes `options.body` to JSON, attaches the
* CSRF token (SEC-008), dispatches through the shared transport (`fetch_api`),
* and resolves the API envelope.
*
* Algorithm:
*  0. Coalescing (READS ONLY): a request carrying
*     `cache_handler:{handler:'localdb', id}` — the caller's explicit declaration
*     that this is an idempotent, cacheable read — joins the in-flight request
*     for the same `cache_handler.id` instead of issuing a second identical
*     round-trip. Writes are NEVER coalesced: they carry no cache_handler, so
*     they cannot even reach the registry. Requests with a caller `signal` and
*     the internal `_csrf_retried` resend bypass coalescing (see
*     `in_flight_requests`). Joined callers on success receive a structuredClone
*     of the envelope, never the leader's object.
*  1. Merge options over the safe defaults (5 retries, 500 ms base delay,
*     5 000 ms timeout) — every default is overridable per call.
*  2. CSRF header from `page_globals.csrf_token` unless the caller set one.
*  3. `cache_handler.handler==='localdb'` → IndexedDB short-circuit on a hit.
*  4. `page_globals.recovery_mode` → `recovery_mode:true` in the body.
*  5. URL / body validation → a `client.*` failure envelope, no network.
*  6. `fetch_api`: fetch never throws on status → body read ONCE → JSON →
*     `normalize_api_error` → retry ONLY when `api_error.retryable` or the
*     server sent `Retry-After` (no status list, no 401/403 carve-outs — an
*     auth/permission answer is an envelope like any other and is dispatched
*     on its CODE). The mid-attempt health probe reports a busy server through
*     the `awaiting_busy_server` notice.
*  7. Refresh `page_globals.csrf_token` from every envelope (success or
*     failure) and publish `session_activity` (WC-051).
*  8. `auth.csrf_failed` → resend exactly once
*     (`_csrf_retried`).
*  9. Failure: attach `error` = the ApiError to the envelope (or synthesise
*     `{ok:false, error}` when no JSON), publish `'api_error'`, toast TRANSPORT
*     failures (the user must learn the network is down even when no caller
*     handles the failure), resolve the envelope.
* 10. Success: publish `'api_notices'` when the envelope carries any, write
*     through to IndexedDB on idle when cached; resolve the envelope.

/**
* READ_STREAM
* Reads an SSE `ReadableStream` chunk-by-chunk and dispatches parsed SSE messages
* to caller-supplied callbacks.
*
* SSE transport quirks handled here:
* - HTTP servers may split a single `data:\n…\n\n` message across multiple chunks
*   (partial message). The `ar_chunks` accumulator collects pieces until the
*   terminating `\n\n` (byte values 10, 10) is detected at the end of the current
*   chunk.
* - The server may also merge two messages into one chunk. In that case the chunk
*   contains `\n\ndata:\n` as an internal separator; the older partial message is
*   discarded (its reassembly is complex and it is never the final message).
* - Each complete message payload is decoded via `TextDecoder`, split on `data:\n`,
*   and the last non-empty part is taken as the current message fragment.
* - JSON parsing uses `JSON_parse_safely` to avoid breaking the read loop on
*   malformed messages; invalid JSON yields a synthetic frame carrying
*   `error` = ApiError `client.bad_response` (source 'stream') — consumers
*   read it with `normalize_stream_error(frame)`, which also understands the
*   server's own end-of-run error frames (v2 `frame.error.code`).
*
* The reader is pushed into `page_globals.stream_readers` so that navigation away
* from the page can abort all in-flight readers. That registry is the LAST resort,
* not the lifecycle: a consumer that stops caring before the page unloads must
* release its own reader with `release_stream_reader` — an SSE stream held open by
* a dead consumer still occupies one of the browser's six per-origin HTTP/1.1
* connections, and six of them starve the whole origin (`/health` included).
*
* (!) This function now releases the reader ITSELF when the stream ends — on
* completion and on a read failure alike. It previously did neither, so the
* registry grew unboundedly and a failed read left both the entry and the
* connection behind.
*
* @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/getReader
* @param {ReadableStream} stream - Body stream obtained from `response.body`
* @param {Function} on_read - Called for each complete SSE message: `on_read(sse_response, reader)`
* @param {Function} on_done - Called EXACTLY ONCE when the stream ends, whatever
*   the reason: `on_done(true)` on normal completion, `on_done(false)` on an
*   abnormal end — a read failure OR a throw out of the consumer's own
*   `on_read`. The reader is released (cancelled and spliced out of
*   `page_globals.stream_readers`) before it fires, on both paths. A throw out
*   of `on_done` itself is reported as a consumer bug and never re-enters it.
* @returns {ReadableStreamDefaultReader} the reader driving this stream, so the
*   caller can release it (see `release_stream_reader`). Returned rather than only
*   handed to `on_read`: a consumer that must cancel BEFORE the first frame arrives
*   had no other way to reach it.

* round trip was paid on every cache lookup, and the accumulated connections
* pinned the database open, so any future `deleteDatabase` could only ever fire
* `onblocked` while the tab lived.
*
* The memo holds the PROMISE, not the handle, so concurrent first callers share
* one open() instead of racing several. It is dropped again whenever the
* connection stops being usable (see the `close` / `versionchange` wiring in
* `get_local_db`), so the next caller transparently reopens.

* - `pagination` — pagination state (replaced the now-deleted `sqo` store)

* already exist, and deletes the legacy `sqo` store if still present.
*
* Resolves with `false` if IndexedDB is unavailable, blocked by another tab
* holding an older version open, or the open otherwise fails — and a failed open
* is never memoized, so the next call retries. Callers must guard against a
* falsy result before proceeding.
*
* (!) `false` on `blocked` means WE gave up, not that the request ended: the
