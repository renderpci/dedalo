/**
* ERROR_DISPATCH
* Executes the policy for an ApiError: `handle_api_error(api_error, ctx)` →
* Promise<{recovered:boolean}>. Callers that can retry (component save,
* build_autoload) just `await` it: `recovered:true` means the cause is gone
* (the user re-logged in) and the call may be repeated; `false` means it was
* shown/handled and the caller stops.
*
* Owns the relogin-then-retry recovery: ONE overlay per session loss no matter
* how many requests failed at once, settled for all of them by ONE decision
* site, `settle_relogin_attempt` (below): it alone asks `relogin_identity` who
* logged in, latches or clears the page identity, settles the pending recovery
* and reloads. The overlay (render_login.js render_relogin) is TRANSPORT — it
* hands the login envelope to the door and resumes only on 'resume'.
* `recovered:true` means the page's OWN user logged back in; any other identity
* reloads the page and latches it (`is_page_identity_revoked`): until it
* reloads, no transport sends anything but the login door
* (`refused_by_page_identity`), so A's queued work never goes out under B's
* session. 'login_successful' is a notification
* published BEFORE the door runs — it is never an authorisation to resume and
* has no subscribers (LEAD-2 + CLIENT-5).
*
* A CSRF token is the same question asked without an overlay: data_manager
* adopts the token an envelope carries (and makes its transparent CSRF resend)
* only through `settle_session_identity` — a session replaced by a login in
* another document latches and reloads this page instead of carrying it over.
*
* Also owns the NOTICE half of the contract (ERRORS_SPEC §3): a SUCCESS
* envelope's `notices[]` go through `handle_api_notice` / `handle_api_notices`,
* the same policy table at severity 'warning' and never a page-level action —
* the request succeeded, so nothing may take the page away from the user.
*
* And it DECLARES the page-wide error signal (ERROR_SIGNAL / signal_error,
* below). That name lived in a module of its own until 2026-09-23, which put a
* 48-line file on the cold-boot critical path for one CustomEvent and broke the
* shrink-only boot budget (page_load_budget_native: 37 modules against 36). It
* belongs here: this file is already on that path and is already one of the two
* producers. The other, error_capture.js, cannot import anything by design and
* repeats the name as a literal — client_error_signal.test.ts refuses the two
* to drift. The only other consumer, the error-report launcher, is lazy and
* imports the constant from here.

*   - this file — an ApiError that was SHOWN (toast, page panel). Silent
*     policies and a recovered relogin are not failures the user can describe,
*     so they never raise the signal.
*
* It is a SIGNAL, not a channel: it carries no error payload beyond a coarse

/**
* HANDLE_API_NOTICE
* The notice half of the contract (ERRORS_SPEC §3): a SUCCESS envelope may
* carry `notices:[{code, label_key, retryable, details}]` — a coded fact that is
* NOT a failure (a refused child delete, a degraded external source, a login
* soft warning). The request succeeded; something the caller should know did
* not go the obvious way.
*
* A notice is dispatched through the SAME policy table an ApiError is, so a
* tool/area silences or re-routes its own domain with `register_error_policy`
* (e.g. `external.*` → `silent`, because the autocomplete chip already renders
* the degradation from `source_status`). The default for a code with no entry
* of its own is the `'*'` row — a toast — at severity `warning`: a notice is
* never red.
*
* The notice is turned into an ApiError-shaped object (same fields, same
* renderer) rather than a second model: `error_text` resolves `label_key` +
* `details` exactly as it does for a failure, and every surface (toast, inline,
* modal) keeps working unchanged.
*
* @param {Object} notice - {code, label_key?, retryable?, details?}
* @param {Object} [ctx] - {wrapper?:HTMLElement, request_id?:string, silent?:bool}
* @return Promise<{recovered:boolean, action:string}>
