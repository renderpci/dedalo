# WC-006 — `tool_common` client machinery relocated to `/dedalo/core/tools_common/`

- **Date:** 2026-07-07 (ledgered retroactively — the gate normalization
  predates this row; found by the 2026-07 test-quality audit).
- **Shape before (PHP):** the shared tool client machinery (`tool_common.js`
  et al.) is served from the tools tree at `/dedalo/tools/tool_common/…`, and
  `get_dedalo_files` manifests those URLs.
- **Shape after (TS):** the machinery lives in `src/core/tools/client` and is
  served at `/dedalo/core/tools_common/…` (see `core/tools/paths.ts` — the
  tools/ tree is TS-owned, not part of the byte-identical client copy). The
  `get_dedalo_files` manifest emits the TS URL; same files, same bytes,
  different base path. The service worker only maps `el.url` into a cache
  Set, so any self-resolvable URL satisfies the client contract.
- **Gate reconciliation:** `dedalo_files_differential.test.ts
  comparableLine()` maps the PHP base onto the TS base before comparing
  (cites this row) and separately asserts every TS URL resolves through the
  server's static surfaces — the rewrite cannot hide a 404.
