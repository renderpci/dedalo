# WC-2026-08-14-relation-insert-target-validation — the relation insert refuses an off-target, unreadable, non-selectable or over-cap locator

- **Date:** 2026-08-14 (the relation `view: "tree"` → thesaurus picker landing; shipped with
  `src/core/relations/save.ts` `refuseByPickerConstraint` +
  `src/core/relations/picker_constraint.ts`).
- **Decision:** — (DEC-12: the rule this closes lived only in a renderer. Canon:
  `engineering/AREA_SPEC.md` §5.7 for the shared resolver, `engineering/RELATIONS_SPEC.md`
  for the save path.)

## The seam

`validateRelationInsert` is the one door every relation locator passes through on its way
into a record — the portal's link, a picker's confirmed selection, the dataframe's frame,
an import row, a maintenance script. It normalized shape (`type`, `type_rel`,
`from_component_tipo`, lang, `paginated_key`, section_id canonicalization, dedup,
autoreference) and asked NOTHING about the target section, the principal's grant on it, the
term's own selectability, or how many locators the component is allowed to hold.

`data_limit` had **zero** occurrences anywhere in `src/`: it was enforced only in
`component_portal.js`. A cap that lives in the renderer is not a cap — it is a suggestion
to whoever uses the supported client.

## Shape before (PHP)

The insert accepted any well-formed locator. Concretely, all four of these were persisted
without complaint:

- a locator whose `section_tipo` is not among the component's declared targets;
- a locator into a section the principal cannot read;
- a term whose thesaurus declares it NOT selectable (`is_indexable` unset on its record) —
  the flag existed and governed the tree's affordances only;
- the N+1st locator on a component declaring `data_limit: N` (the browser alerted; the API
  did not).

The response reported a pagination `total` and no per-locator verdict, because there was no
verdict to report.

## Shape after (TS)

Four refusals, resolved SERVER-SIDE from the caller ddo through the shared
`relations/picker_constraint.ts` — the same module the picker read calls for its
affordances — and run AFTER the dedup, on the resulting row set, inside the caller's
transaction (the row is already locked `FOR UPDATE`). Each refusal carries a machine code
and a human reason:

| code | refused when |
|---|---|
| `off_target` | `isTargetAllowed(constraint.targets, locator.section_tipo)` is false. BOTH sides are resolved through `getSectionRealTipo`, so a virtual target matches its real section and vice versa. |
| `target_not_readable` | `getSectionPermissions(actor, target) < 1`. |
| `term_not_selectable` | `isTermSelectable(section_tipo, section_id)` is false — the term's OWN answer, the same `isIndexable` rule the tree renders. |
| `selection_limit` | the resulting row count would exceed the caller's re-resolved `properties.data_limit`. |

Three DECLARED EXEMPTIONS, each a `reason` on its branch rather than a silent skip:

- **No declared target** — a caller whose resolved sqo names no section has no target
  constraint. That is "no constraint exists", not "nothing is allowed".
- **No actor** — an UNDEFINED principal (import, CLI, background job, unit harness) applies
  no read filter, the same posture the permission layer already documents for ddo
  authorization.
- **No selectability contract** — the gate applies only where the caller declares
  `properties.view: 'tree'` (it is a picker) AND the target's `section_map.thesaurus`
  names an `is_indexable` component (it has an answer to give). A component whose targets
  are not thesaurus sections has no such contract, and `set_data` re-persists a whole stored
  array through this door — gating it unconditionally would silently drop terms stored
  before their section gained the flag, which is data loss wearing a security argument.

The cap arithmetic is stated because it decides behaviour: refusal is
`resulting > selection_limit && resulting > held`, so a component ALREADY over a limit
tightened after the fact can still be rewritten (an update lands on the same count) but
never grown.

**Known hole, named rather than hidden:** a `view: 'tree'` declared in a `ddo_map` entry
rather than on the node is not visible to this door, which has no caller-ddo context. The 7
node-level declarations are gated; the 8 ddo_map ones are not, and closing that needs the
caller ddo threaded through the save request.

## Reason

A rule enforced only in the renderer is an invariant with no gate — the exact shape DEC-12
forbids — and here it is a data-integrity surface, not a cosmetic one. The picker makes it
load-bearing rather than theoretical: a multi-select tray hands the save N locators at once,
so `data_limit` and dedup become properties of the SET (see
`WC-2026-08-14-relation-insert-accepts-batch`), and N individually-legal picks can
collectively break a cap that is only ever checked one request at a time.

The asymmetry with the read path is the whole design: the read resolves the constraint for
the AFFORDANCES the tree offers, the write re-resolves it for PERSISTENCE. One resolver,
two call sites — so a rendered affordance is never mistaken for an authorization, and a
forged or stale client cap changes nothing.

## What a consumer must expect

1. A locator the retired engine stored can now be refused. The refusals are NAMED, per
   locator, with a stable `code`; a client should render a catalog label keyed on the code,
   never the English `reason` (which is a server diagnostic).
2. Off-target and non-selectable locators arriving through the LEGACY single-locator door
   are dropped and logged rather than thrown — that is that door's pre-existing
   "null = ignored" contract. Callers wanting the reason must use the batch door.
3. Nothing about the dataframe frame shape changes: `normalizeDataframeEntry` still forces
   `type`, `from_component_tipo`, `main_component_tipo` and `id_key` from the server-side
   pairing.

## Gate reconciliation

- `test/unit/relation_insert_target_native.test.ts` — the seven codes against the save API
  directly (never through the client), on a scratch twin: in-target accepted, off-target
  refused, a VIRTUAL target accepted, a target the principal cannot read refused, a
  non-selectable term refused THOUGH THE CLIENT SENT IT, and `data_limit` exceeded refused;
  plus each declared exemption exercised so an exemption cannot silently become the rule.
- `test/unit/dataframe_write_contract_native.test.ts`,
  `test/unit/dataframe_idkey_native.test.ts`, `test/unit/ws_a_tripwires.test.ts` — the
  pre-existing write contract, unchanged by the added gates.
- `test/unit/thesaurus_picker_tripwire.test.ts` — the client stamps no relation `type`, so
  the dedup key this door refuses against is the server's.

**Re-harvest: NOT APPLICABLE.** A refusal on a request the retired engine ACCEPTED has no
fixture twin — the frozen store contains no such interaction (measured: no fixture request
carries a picker declaration, and the store holds no write of an off-target locator).
Nothing in the store's replayed bytes changes; there is nothing to re-harvest and, per
`engineering/ORACLE_HARVEST.md`, no way to.

## Addendum 2026-08-16 — gate 2 scoped and fail-closed; the length-1 door THROWS

Three corrections from the adversarial review of the landing, all in
`src/core/relations/save.ts`:

1. **`target_not_readable` is SCOPED to tree-picker callers** (the same scope as the
   selectability gate: the caller declares `properties.view: 'tree'`). As landed, gate 2
   judged the target section for EVERY caller and refused every non-admin's own
   component_filter → `dd153` pick — profiles grant the FILTER component (level 2), never
   the projects SECTION (level 0), and the datalist was built from the user's own
   authorized projects (measured: all 20 non-admin users of the test DB). The read model
   for a portal/autocomplete/filter/select is the opposite of that gate: a value reached
   THROUGH an authorized caller is floored to read (`permissions.inheritSubdatumPermission`),
   so authorization there IS the caller grant, which dispatch enforces (`>= 2` on the
   component) before the door is reached. For a tree picker the gate stays: it is the write
   twin of the picker READ, which prunes hierarchies the principal holds no grant on.
2. **The "no actor" posture inside that scope is FAIL-CLOSED**, not an exemption: a
   net-new pick into a tree-picker caller with no principal — neither threaded
   (`SaveRequest.principal`, passed by dispatch and the MCP write tools) nor ambient
   (the request-context ALS, now the documented BACKSTOP only) — is refused
   `target_not_readable`. The table's "No actor" exemption row above is therefore
   RETIRED for gate 2. Credless doors (import, maintenance) re-persist stored arrays
   through the `storedItems` baseline (gate 0) and are unaffected.
3. **Constraint refusals through the length-1 door are THROWN, not dropped.** "What a
   consumer must expect" item 2 above is superseded: `validateRelationInsert` now throws
   `relation.insert_refused` (400, `details: {constraint, section_tipo}`) for
   `off_target` / `term_not_selectable` / `selection_limit`, and the generic `perm.denied`
   (403, naming nothing) for `target_not_readable`. The save transaction rolls back and the
   API answers the named refusal; a 200-with-nothing-stored was a silent scope narrowing.
   The PHP-era drops (`bad_form` / `autoreference` / `duplicate`) keep the null/ignored
   contract — the client's server-authoritative duplicate check depends on it.

Also in the same pass: the selection cap counts `held` in the CAP SCOPE (per main item for
a dataframe pairing — `picker_constraint.inCapScope`, one predicate for both sides), and
the re-persist baseline compares through the locator law (`compareLocators`: section_id
loose-numeric, tipo strict; frame pairing String()-loose) instead of key-string equality.

Gates: `test/unit/relation_insert_target_native.test.ts` — the READ GRANT describe (tree
picker refused / non-picker accepted / fail-closed no-actor / threaded principal wins /
the component_filter non-admin persists a project through the REAL save door), the
RE-PERSIST baseline describe, the DATAFRAME cap describe, and the save-path describe
asserting the wire status + code. `test/unit/external_write_refusal_tripwire.test.ts`'s
"curated write" fixture now names a caller that DECLARES its target (`test80` → test3);
the previous fixture (`numisdata434`, absent from the suite DB) was green only because the
door silently dropped it.

## Addendum 2026-08-17 — a TOOL's ddo_map is a second target declaration

`constraint.targets` (and so gate 1, `off_target`) resolved ONE declaration channel: the
caller component's own `request_config`. The ontology has a second one. A tool's
`properties.tool_config.<tool>.ddo_map` wires a working surface whose entries are linked to
each other, and some of those entries are SECTIONS the operator picks from, published into
a sibling entry that is a relation component.

tool_indexation is the live case, and the regression it produced was reported from a
running install: its map pairs `indexing_component` (rsc860, the portal that stores the
links) with `people_section` (rsc197, a plain section browsed as a thesaurus list), and
`tools/tool_indexation/js/tool_indexation.js` assigns
`people_section.linker = indexing_component`. rsc860's own request_config resolves to
hierarchies (`source: 'hierarchy_types'`) and never names rsc197, so indexing a PERSON —
the tool's central workflow, and the affordance the client rendered from the very
tool_config the server had served it — was refused `off_target` at the write door. Two
authorities declared what may be linked; only one was enforced. (Both halves are recent:
the gate landed 2026-08-15, the list-row pick affordance 2026-08-15/17. Nothing
long-standing regressed — the two simply never agreed.)

`picker_constraint.resolveTargets` now UNIONS the tool-declared sources into the caller's
own, from the same ontology bytes the client was handed, so the affordance and the
persistence stay one answer. The rules, stated once and enforced by the index:

- **The pair is declared, never inferred.** `src/core/tools/picker_wiring.ts` holds one
  `{sourceRole, linkerRole}` list per tool — `tool_indexation: people_section →
  indexing_component` — mirroring the tool's own JS wiring in both live
  spellings (`tool_indexation.js:501,:753` direct; `:526` and
  `tool_cataloging.js:316` through `attach_picker`'s `linker` option). Two of the three
  declared pairs GRANT NOTHING — their source role is an `area_thesaurus`, never a
  `model: 'section'` entry — and are declared so the table stays total over the tree's real
  wirings, because an undeclared one is how a picker starts refusing silently the day an
  install configures it. A tool absent from the table declares no picker link and
  contributes nothing. `test/unit/tool_picker_wiring_tripwire.test.ts` fails when the table
  and the JS disagree in either direction, so the two copies of that fact cannot drift.
- A SOURCE is the entry carrying `sourceRole` whose tipo resolves to a section (model read
  from the ontology — the stored map carries no `model` key; `enrichToolConfig` stamps it
  for the wire from the same lookup) and that names a literal `section_tipo`; a `self`
  sentinel is the host section, not a picker source, and is skipped.
- A LINKER is the entry carrying `linkerRole` AND of the PORTAL family (`LINKER_MODELS` —
  the canonical model `component_autocomplete`/`_hi` collapse into): the components whose
  stored value IS a browsed record link.
- **Why not a cross-product over the map.** The first shape of this fix paired every
  section in a ddo_map with every relation component in it, and over-granted twice on the
  live map: to `references_component` (rsc1368, a portal that DISPLAYS inverse references
  and receives no picks) and — before the family narrowing — to the status checkbox and
  select (rsc437/rsc439), whose values come from their own option lists. A ddo_map wires a
  whole working surface; only one pair of it is a link declaration, and a WRITE gate must
  not widen on a guess about the rest. Measured after the fix on dedalo7_mht: rsc860 gains
  rsc197; rsc1368, rsc437 and rsc439 gain nothing.
- **The empty-target exemption is untouched.** A caller resolving to NO target keeps the
  "no target constraint exists" answer; unioning a tool source into an empty set would
  invent a refusal nobody declared (every other section would start failing).
- **Target gate only.** Gates 2-4 — the read grant on the linked section, selectability,
  the cap — run unchanged on every locator arriving through a tool-declared source.

Wire effect: `context.picker.targets` (the read side of the same resolver) gains the
tool-declared sections for those callers — a WIDENING of a list the client only displays
and never enforces. The derived index is built by an ontology-wide `tool_config` property
scan and memoized through `createOntologyCache`, so a tool_config edit takes effect on the
next resolve rather than on a restart.

Gates: `test/unit/relation_insert_target_native.test.ts` — the TARGET describe's
tool-declared five (the source accepted for the wired linker; the same section still
refused for an identically-targeted caller in no ddo_map; a PORTAL in an unwired role of
the same map gaining nothing; the wired role held by a non-portal model gaining nothing;
the no-declaration caller keeping its exemption), verified red before the change and green
after — plus `test/unit/tool_picker_wiring_tripwire.test.ts` (new tripwire, indexed in
`engineering/TRIPWIRES.md` and `scripts/verify.ts`) marrying the table to the tool JS.
