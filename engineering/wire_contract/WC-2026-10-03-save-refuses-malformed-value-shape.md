# WC-2026-10-03-save-refuses-malformed-value-shape — the save door refuses a value its model does not store

- **Date:** 2026-10-03.
- **Decision:** DEC-12 (the law lands with its gate:
  `test/unit/value_shape_native.test.ts`). Code: `src/core/section/record/value_shape.ts`
  (`valueShapeRefusal`), called by `saveComponentData` (`save_component.ts`) before the
  transaction opens; the import door's normalization in `src/core/tools/import_conform.ts`
  (`conformNumber` / `numberItems`, `textItem`); the re-save doors' normalization of stored
  PHP-era items, `canonicalStoredItems` (`value_shape.ts`), called by `tool_update_cache` and
  `tool_propagate_component_data`; the RDF importer's cast of a literal into a number
  component (`itemFor`, `tools/tool_import_rdf/server/rdf_import_plan.ts`).

## Shape before

**PHP** `component_common::set_data` WRAPPED a non-object element into `{value: <element>}`
and `component_number::set_data` cast a numeric string (`is_numeric`) and dropped a
non-numeric one, both logging and answering success.

**TS until this entry** stored whatever arrived, ok:true (measured 2026-10-03 on a scratch
twin):

- `{action:'update', key:0, value:'<bare string>'}` on a translatable
  component_input_text persisted the bare string beside the other languages' items; the
  next save in another language DROPPED it (the lang-sliced merge discards non-objects), so
  the second language replaced the first;
- `update` with `value:null` stored a `null` item; a number `value:55` stored `[55]`,
  `{value:'55'}` a string no numeric search matches;
- a non-array `set_data` (or one with scalar/null elements) emptied the language slice.

## Shape after (TS)

`saveComponentData` refuses, before the transaction (nothing written, no counter raised, no
Time Machine row, a missing record not created), with **`request.invalid_data`**
(caller/400, disclosure `operator`; coordinates name `tipo` and `model`) any
value-carrying change whose shape the model's column does not store:

- `insert` / `update`: `value` must be ONE plain object item;
- `set_data`: `value` must be an array of plain object items, or null (the explicit empty);
- the literal families type the fields the engine reads — absent and null always accepted
  (the client's empty slot is `{value:null}`): `string` → `value` a string; `number` →
  `value` a finite number; `date` → `start`/`end`/`period` objects; `iri` → `iri`/`title`
  strings. `misc`, `geo`, `media`, `relation` get the item-ness check (relation locators are
  then normalized by `validateRelationInsert`, which a bare scalar used to bypass);
- `section_id` is exempt (component_section_id stores the bare record id);
- `remove`, `clear`, `sort_*`, `add_new_element` carry no item and are untouched.

The refusal names the value's KIND, never its content (it can be a password).

**Divergence from PHP, deliberately:** no wrapping, no cast at the save door. A door that
legitimately holds a looser shape normalizes it there: the CSV/JSON importer casts a JSON
number cell's numeric strings (PHP `is_numeric` grammar; a non-numeric one is refused for
the cell, never stored or silently dropped) and writes a JSON number in a text cell as its
string.

**Stored PHP-era data — the re-save doors.** Two server doors read STORED items and send
them back through `set_data`: `tool_update_cache` regenerate and
`tool_propagate_component_data` (the untouched region re-sent with `final`). Stored data is
PHP-era as well as TS-era, and the PHP era kept number values as strings that its
`set_data` cast on save — measured 2026-10-03 on a PHP-era corpus (read-only): 26
component_number items with a string `value` (e.g. `{"id":1,"value":"0"}`), no other
literal-field drift in the string/number/date/iri columns. Without a cast those doors were
refused on every such record, where they used to be a no-op re-save. Both now pass the
stored items through `canonicalStoredItems(column, items)` (`value_shape.ts`) first: a
number column's numeric string is cast with the same PHP `is_numeric` grammar
(`PHP_NUMERIC`, the one copy the importer also uses; `''` → null), a text column's JSON
number becomes its numeral. A value no cast reads is left as stored and the door refuses
it for that record, loud. The read path (`readComponentItems`) is unchanged — the wire
still serves what is stored; the cast happens at the re-save door. Gate:
`value_shape_native.test.ts` F (pure) and G (both doors, end to end, over a seeded
PHP-era string number).

**The RDF importer** (`tool_import_rdf`, dated 2026-10-03, review finding). Its plan built
every literal item as `{lang, value: <text>}` except for component_iri, so a literal mapped
to a component_number — the Nomisma mapping's `nmo:hasWeight`, `nmo:hasDiameter`,
`nmo:hasAxis` (owl:ObjectProperty nodes, no `process`) — reached the door as a string, was
refused, and every weight/diameter/axis op rolled back to its savepoint as a
`request.invalid_data` skip (Dédalo 6's set_data cast it). The plan now reads the target's
column (`RdfTipoInfo.number`, from the engine's `getColumnNameByModel`, the door's own
lookup) and casts the text with `PHP_NUMERIC` (surrounding blanks ignored, non-finite
refused) into `{lang, value: <number>}` — for a set, a split of the subject IRI and a
number match component alike. Text that spells no number is a plan skip `number_unparsed`,
reported, never sent. Gates: `rdf_import_plan.test.ts` (*numbers*, *a number match
component*, the engine reader's number flag) and `rdf_import_execute_native.test.ts` (a
cast number stored as a number; the uncast string refused per op).

## Census (what sends a value-carrying change)

Measured 2026-10-03 (a static census, then `bun run test:client` with the server log
searched for the refusal): the client builders of `insert`/`update`/`set_data` send an
object item (`{value:null}` for an empty slot) or route a null value to `remove`; null
`set_data` comes only from relation pickers. ONE shipped exception, fixed at its door in
the same change: component_date's edit `change_handler` sent `update` with `value:null`
when a date input was emptied (stored as a `null` item until now). It now builds through
`build_date_changed_data_item` (`render_edit_component_date.js`) — a `remove` of the stored
item id, nothing for a never-stored slot — the same builder its remove button uses. Two
client-suite cases (date, geolocation) that mimicked the null update were moved to the
remove they meant; after the change the client run logs no refusal. Every server caller of
`saveComponentData` (importers, tools, MCP, maintenance) builds object items — but that
census checked item-ness only, not field types: ONE server door sent a string into the
number column, fixed at its door (see *The RDF importer* below). The MCP
`dedalo_save_component` documents `value` as `{id, value, lang}` or a locator; an agent's
bare scalar is now refused with the same code. The temporal door
(`section/record/temporal.ts`) is not covered: it persists nothing, and its relation
callers (`render_draw.js`) pass a single locator to `set_data`, which it accepts.

## Reason

A write that stores a shape no reader serves is a silent loss: the value is either
invisible or destroys its sibling language on the next save, while the caller was told it
succeeded. Refusing is the only answer that keeps the stored data readable.
