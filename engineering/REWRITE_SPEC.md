# Dédalo → TypeScript/Bun Greenfield Rewrite — Master Spec

> Standing specification for the TS/Bun rewrite. Authored 2026-07-01 with the project owner.
> PHP reference tree: `../../v7/master_dedalo/` (READ-ONLY). This tree: the rewrite workspace.

## Context

Dédalo is a large, mature, **ontology-driven** content/collections platform currently written in PHP (~3,663 PHP files) with a framework-free vanilla-JS client (~2,606 JS files), a LESS design system, and a PostgreSQL JSONB "matrix" data model. Everything in the app — menus, areas, sections, components, tools, buttons, widgets — is *generated from the ontology*, not hard-coded. A small amount of TypeScript/Bun already exists in production only for the **diffusion** engine (`diffusion/api/v1/`, MariaDB) and the MCP server.

This document is the **standing master prompt** for the effort that re-implements the Dédalo **server** as a native TypeScript application running on **Bun**, from scratch, in this tree, while the PHP tree remains the untouched functional reference. This is a *greenfield* — freed from PHP's file/class organization and its sequential execution model — but it must preserve 100% of current functionality, the database schema and per-component data structures, and the conceptual API contract, and it must be **at least as secure** as the PHP version. Per explicit direction: the wire contract may be **modernized freely** (the client's server-call layer may be adapted at the seam; CSS and view JS are copied as the base), auth is a **new native TS design** (not PHP-session-compatible).

# PROMPT: Re-implement the Dédalo server in native TypeScript on Bun

## 1. Mission

Rebuild the Dédalo **server** as a modern, native TypeScript application on the **Bun** runtime, from scratch. Preserve every current functionality of the PHP server, but build it freely in idiomatic TS/Bun without inheriting PHP's structure or its one-request-one-sequential-process model. Exploit JS/TS concurrency (async/await, `Promise.all`, worker threads, streaming) to make the API materially faster than the sequential PHP. Design with **AI integration** as a first-class concern from day one.

**You are not translating PHP line by line.** You are re-expressing a well-understood system. Understand the *contracts and semantics* deeply, then implement them the best modern way.

## 2. Absolute constraints (non-negotiable)

1. **Do not modify the PHP project** at `v7/master_dedalo/`. It is the source of truth and functional reference — read it, never write it.
2. **Preserve the database schema and data model exactly.** The PostgreSQL JSONB **matrix** tables (`matrix`, `matrix_default`, `matrix_list`, `matrix_hierarchy`, `matrix_hierarchy_main`, `matrix_langs`, `matrix_tools`, `matrix_time_machine`, etc.) and the **per-component `data` JSON structures** stored inside them must be read and written byte-compatibly with the PHP version. Both servers must be able to run against the same database without corrupting each other's data.
3. **At least as secure as PHP.** Every security chokepoint in §7 must have an equal-or-stronger equivalent. Never ship a regression in the security posture.
4. **Independent projects.** The TS tree has its own directory architecture, its own config system, and its own runtime. The PHP and TS developer versions must each run standalone — including independent config definitions (no shared runtime config files, no shared sessions).
5. **Copy, don't rewrite, the client view layer.** The vanilla-JS client and the LESS/CSS are copied from PHP as the starting base. You may *adapt the client's server-communication layer* (the code that builds RQO/SQO and calls the API) to match a modernized wire contract — but the rendering/view/CSS stays as-is.
6. **RAG, Agent, and MCP are greenfield.** The PHP implementations of these are **not in production** — do **not** port them. Design them fresh in TS/Bun when their phase comes, taking advantage of native tooling.

## 2b. Code style & maintainability (standing rule)

Write the TypeScript with **long-term development** in mind. This code will be read, extended, and debugged for years by both **new human developers and AI agents** — optimize for their comprehension over cleverness.
- **Prefer the most standardized, idiomatic, boring options.** Favor widely-used, conventional TS/Bun patterns and mainstream libraries over exotic ones, so anyone (human or AI) can onboard quickly. You have freedom in *how* you build, but bias toward the least-surprising choice.
- **Readable names, always.** No cryptic short identifiers (`kk`, `x2`, `tmp3`, …). Variables, functions, and types must be self-descriptive and pronounceable by a human.
- **Comment and describe generously.** Every module, non-trivial function, type, and tricky branch gets a clear comment explaining *what it does and why* — especially where it re-expresses a Dédalo concept (RQO/SQO/ddo_map/locator/subdatum/context-vs-data) so a newcomer or an AI agent can follow the intent without reverse-engineering PHP. Document the contracts, not just the mechanics.
- **Consistency over local optimization.** Keep naming, file layout, error handling, and async patterns uniform across the codebase.
- **When a requirement or a Dédalo concept is ambiguous, ask** rather than guessing — surface the question instead of inventing behavior.

## 3. Prime directive: learn the core concepts before writing any code

Dédalo's entire behavior is an emergent property of a small set of interlocking concepts. **You must internalize all of them before planning or writing implementation code.** Study them in the PHP reference at the file:line anchors given, confirm your mental model against real ontology records and API responses, then re-implement their *semantics* — not their PHP shape.

The core vocabulary: **Ontology, RQO, SQO, Locator, ddo / ddo_map, request_config (implicit vs explicit), Context vs Data, Subdatum.**

### 3.1 Ontology — the core of everything
Every menu, area, section, component, tool, button, and widget is *defined by* an ontology node (a record with a `tipo` like `dd207`, a `model` = the class/behavior, a `parent`, and a `properties` JSON blob). There are no bespoke feature tables — new capability comes from new ontology definitions plus a `model` that knows how to resolve them. The ontology also carries the schema flexibility that makes Dédalo Dédalo. **Model the ontology as the resolver/registry that produces every runtime instance's structure.**

### 3.2 RQO — Request Query Object (the API request contract)
The client's request to resolve/read/act on data. Canonical top-level keys (`class.request_query_object.php:360`): `id`, `api_engine`, `dd_api`, `action`, `source`, `sqo`, `show`, `search`, `choose`, `data`, `prevent_lock`, `options`, `pretty_print`. `source` names the target (`model`, `tipo`, `section_tipo`, `section_id`, `mode`, `lang`). `show`/`search`/`choose` each carry a **`ddo_map`** (see 3.4) plus `sqo_config`.
- Parse/validate/dispatch reference: `core/api/v1/json/index.php` → `dd_manager::sanitize_client_rqo()` → `dd_manager::manage_request()` → `<dd_api>::<action>()` → `dd_core_api::read()` → `build_json_rows()`.
- **The RQO defines a component-resolution over a `ddo_map` chain**; each `ddo` says how one component is resolved; components that point to related sections carry further `ddo`s resolved deeply via the `parent` property (see 3.4). This chain *is* the heart of the RQO.

### 3.3 SQO — Search Query Object (the query contract)
An ontology-driven, Mango/CouchDB-inspired abstraction over the JSONB matrix that compiles to SQL. Reference: `core/common/class.search_query_object.php`, compiled by `core/search/class.search.php` (+ `search_tm`, `search_related`, and the `select/from/where/order/count/utils` traits). Key fields: `section_tipo` (mandatory, array — **one or many target sections**; multi-section triggers `UNION ALL` under a `mix` alias), `mode`, `filter` (`$and`/`$or` trees of leaf clauses with `q`, `q_operator`, `path:[{section_tipo,component_tipo}]`, `format`, `use_function`, `lang`, …), `select`, `order`, `limit`, `offset`, `full_count`, `filter_by_locators`, and server-only flags. SQO has a two-phase life: **conform/parse** (per-component `resolve_query_object_sql()` builds SQL fragments + bound params) then **SQL build** (FROM→SELECT→ORDER→WHERE→projects-filter, load-bearing order). **Preserve the SQO as pure data; keep identifier validation and value parameterization strictly separate (see §7).**

### 3.4 ddo / ddo_map — the resolution graph
A **ddo** (data-description object) describes how to resolve one component in a response. Client-allowed display fields (`class.request_config_object.php:683`): `tipo`, `section_tipo` (`self` = current section), `parent`, `mode`, `lang`, `view`, `label`, separators, `value_with_parents`, `column_id`, `width`, `limit`, `offset`, etc.
- **The `parent` property is the key.** A `ddo_map` is a flat list; it becomes a tree because each ddo's `parent` equals the `tipo` of the ddo it hangs under (`parent:"self"` = direct child of the calling component). Resolution walks the map, taking only direct children at each level, then recursing (`class.common.php:2295` `get_children_recursive`, and `:2454` the `parent === $this->tipo` filter). This is how a component that relates to another section carries the sub-components to resolve *in that related section*, to arbitrary depth, declaratively and without per-relation code.

### 3.5 Locator — the universal relation pointer
The value object that connects sections. Reference `core/common/class.locator.php`. Mandatory: `section_tipo`, `section_id`. Optional/relational: `component_tipo`, `from_component_tipo`, `type`, `type_rel`, `tag_id`/`tag_component_tipo`/`tag_type`, `lang`, and the **dataframe pairing** field `id_key` (the stable main-item id; legacy `section_id_key`/`section_tipo_key` still read for BC) plus `main_component_tipo`. Relation components store arrays of locators; **subdatum** expands those locators into resolved child component data. Preserve locator equality/lookup semantics (`compare_locators`, `in_array_locator`, `build_locator_lookup_key`) — relation data integrity depends on them.

### 3.6 request_config — how relation components resolve (implicit vs explicit; PHP oracle names them v5/v6)
Every relation component declares how to resolve its target(s):
- **IMPLICIT (legacy; PHP v5):** no explicit config; child component tipos are derived by walking the ontology relation graph (`trait.request_config_v5.php`). `component_relation_parent`/`children` are **not** supported here and require explicit config.
- **EXPLICIT (modern; PHP v6):** `properties.source.request_config` in the ontology defines `show`/`search`/`choose`/`hide` ddo_maps plus the **SQO** that names the target section(s) and data filters, plus an optional external `api_engine`/`api_config` (`trait.request_config_v6.php`, `class.request_config_object.php:41`). Support both; explicit is the default builder.

### 3.7 Context vs Data — the two definitions every data element has
Every component/section/widget that manages data has **two** definitions:
- **Context** = the ontology-derived *structure* needed to instantiate it: label, tipo, model, properties, translatable, css, tools, buttons, columns_map, and the resolved `request_config`. Built + cached by the structure-context core (`class.common.php:1604`/`:1739`), then per-call **stamped** with variant fields (permissions, parent, lang, request_config, view). It is **immutable within a request** — always clone before mutating; never leak the cache by reference (`:1644`).
- **Data** = the instance value(s) for a specific record/lang, lazily loaded from the matrix (`component_common::get_data()`; e.g. `[{id, value, lang}]`). Context can be built without paying for data I/O.
Keep this split. It is what makes caching, permissions capping, and lazy loading tractable.

### 3.8 Subdatum — the recursive glue
`subdatum` is the recursive expansion of child-component data through the `request_config`/`ddo_map` hierarchy, bridging a parent's stored **locators** to their resolved child **values** (`class.common.php:2254` `get_subdatum()`; dataframe variant `trait.dataframe_common.php:395`). Output shape: `{context, data}` (deduplicated child structures + resolved data rows). Portals and relations are all built on it. The dataframe **id_key** contract (pairing frame records to individual data items of a main component, never by array index) must be preserved exactly.

> **Deliverable gate:** Before writing feature code, produce a written model of these eight concepts *as you will implement them in TS* (types + resolver flow), and validate it by replaying real RQO/SQO requests from the PHP server and matching the resolved context/data/subdatum semantics.

## 4. Architecture & runtime

- **Reverse proxy in front:** Apache/Nginx serves static assets and media and enforces media access control, and **proxies API traffic to Bun over a unix socket** (as the existing diffusion engine already does). Design the Bun server to listen on a socket and to be horizontally runnable.
- **Bun serves all dynamic content / the API.** Own your own HTTP layer, routing, and dispatch.
- **PostgreSQL is the system of record** (same schema/matrix as PHP). Use Bun-native Postgres access with prepared statements; preserve the matrix read/write contract.
  > **AMENDED 2026-07-07 (S3-38 — native diffusion engine).** The parenthetical that stood here ("MariaDB remains the *old external* diffusion engine's concern — do not entangle core with it") predates the native rebuild. Since 2026-07-05 diffusion is a **native TS subsystem of this server**: `src/diffusion/` (parsers, writers, plan compiler, job queue/scheduler, MariaDB target). The rule is now: **MariaDB lives ONLY under `src/diffusion/targets/mariadb/`; `src/core/**` never constructs a MariaDB client and never imports `src/diffusion/**` except through the sanctioned facade seams.** Authority: `engineering/DIFFUSION_SPEC.md` §2; mechanically enforced by `test/unit/diffusion_boundaries.test.ts` (direction + MariaDB confinement) and `test/unit/boundary_seam_tripwire.test.ts` (facade-only seam growth). Cutover levers: `DEDALO_DIFFUSION_NATIVE*` (../private/.env).
- **Exploit concurrency the PHP could not:** resolve independent components/subdatums with `Promise.all`, stream large search/export responses, parallelize per-section `UNION` branches and per-row context building, cache structure-context in-process with correct invalidation, and offload CPU-bound work (media, embeddings) to workers. Latency reduction versus sequential PHP is an explicit success metric.
- **Persistent-runtime discipline (critical):** Bun is a long-lived process, unlike PHP's per-request lifecycle. **Any state that PHP kept in per-request statics/globals must become per-request scoped in TS.** No cross-request bleed of session, permissions, language, caches, or headers. (This is the single biggest correctness risk in a persistent rewrite — treat request isolation as a design invariant, not an afterthought.)

## 5. Config & independence
Design a self-contained TS config system (env-based, its own catalog, outside the web root for secrets), conceptually equivalent to the PHP `../private/.env` + catalog + per-entity routing, but **not shared** with PHP. Both trees must boot and run independently. Support the same multi-tenant/per-entity notion (one deployment, multiple databases/instances).

## 6. Functional scope to preserve
Re-implement, ontology-driven, the full surface: **38 component models** (data-entry, media, relation family, structural, portal, dataframe, geolocation, iri, etc.), **13 areas**, **35 tools**, the **widget** and **button** families, sections/section_record lifecycle (create/read/update/delete, locking via `prevent_lock`), the **search** subsystem, the **thesaurus/ontology tree**, the **time machine**, **import/export**, **datalist** resolution, **diffusion** integration points, and **media protection**. Use the PHP `_json.php` controllers and per-component search traits as behavioral specs. Match each component's stored `data` structure exactly.

## 7. Security — meet or exceed every chokepoint
Re-implement all of the following with equal-or-greater strength (PHP reference in parentheses):
1. **API class + action allowlists.** Only known api classes are dispatchable; when a class declares its action allowlist, enforce it; handlers are explicitly registered (not reflection over arbitrary methods). (`dd_manager` `$allowed_api_classes`, `API_ACTIONS`.)
2. **Auth gate + new native auth.** Design a modern TS auth/session from scratch (e.g. signed, rotating tokens + server-side session store) that is **not** PHP-session-compatible but preserves every guarantee: session-fixation resistance (rotate on login), Argon2id password verification with lazy upgrade, brute-force throttling (sliding window, per namespace|user|ip), maintenance-mode gating, optional SAML with IdP-IP allowlisting. (`class.login.php`.)
3. **CSRF-equivalent protection** for state-changing actions, with a defined exempt-action set, constant-time comparison. (`dd_manager` CSRF.)
4. **Authorization / permissions matrix.** Three-tier ACL (schema-level (section_tipo,component_tipo)→0–3; per-record projects filter; hard-coded bypasses for superuser/tools/maintenance/time-machine), computed with a layered cache and correct invalidation, and enforced **before** search runs and **per-SQO-target**. Permissions are capped per caller and are **server-authoritative** — never trust client-supplied permission or `skip_projects_filter`-style flags. (`class.security.php`.)
5. **SQO sanitization gate** on every untrusted SQO at the API boundary: strip server-only keys (`sentence`, `params`, `column_sql`, `table`, `table_alias`, `skip_projects_filter`, `skip_duplicated`, `include_negative`), clamp `limit`/`offset`/`total`, force re-parse. (`search_query_object::sanitize_client_sqo`.)
6. **Identifier validation chokepoint.** `section_tipo`/`component_tipo`/`lang`/column names are interpolated into JSONB keys/jsonpath and **cannot** be parameterized — validate every one against strict allowlists at a single chokepoint before any SQL is built (`is_valid_tipo` `^[a-z]+[0-9]+$`, `is_valid_lang` `^(lg-[a-z0-9_]+|all)$`, the fixed matrix-column allowlist). (`conform_filter`, `trait.utils.php`.)
7. **Value parameterization.** All dynamic values go through prepared-statement parameters; JSONB operators are fixed fragments. Zero string-concatenated user values.
8. **ddo_map sanitization.** Whitelist client-supplied ddo fields to the display allowlist only.
9. **Media access control.** Preserve the web-server-enforced model: fixed-name daily-rotated auth cookie + `.publication/auth` markers (Rule A), publication markers + quality allowlist + filename grammar (Rule B), fail-closed 404s, path-traversal guards, script-exec blocking. Keep the marker store, `media_index`, and rewrite rules in lockstep. (`class.media_protection.php`.)
Also carry over: failed-login timing/ambiguity, activity logging, and never revealing record/media existence to the unauthorized.

## 8. AI integration (design-in, build greenfield)
Architect the server so AI is native, not bolted on: clean typed service boundaries, structured tool/action schemas, and data access suitable for embedding/retrieval. **RAG, Agent, and MCP are fresh greenfield builds** (do not port the non-production PHP versions) — but leave the seams for them from the start (e.g. a way to expose ontology-typed data and actions to LLM tools, respecting the same ACL as human access). Default to the latest, most capable Claude models when wiring AI features.

> **Work-system MCP foundation (built 2026-07-07).** One shared, ACL-gated tool registry serves the stdio MCP server, the in-app `dd_mcp_api` bridge (the tool_assistant chat), and the server-side agent loop. Discovery/search/read + fail-closed write tiers, a propose→confirm→apply change-plan protocol for the image→extract→fill-ontology flow, and image-capable vision input. Details: **`rewrite/ai/mcp.md`**; catalog diff vs the PHP reference + the security-pass scope: **`rewrite/ai/mcp_review.md`**.

## 9. Method & sequencing (how to proceed)
1. **Concept mastery + type foundations** — implement the §3 concepts as TS types and resolver skeletons; validate against live PHP responses (§3 gate).
2. **DB + matrix layer** — Bun-native Postgres, matrix read/write parity, prepared-statement discipline; round-trip real records byte-for-byte.
3. **SQO engine** — pure-data SQO → conform → SQL, with the §7 gates; verify generated SQL/results against PHP for representative queries (single- and multi-section, filters, order, pagination, full_count).
4. **Context/Data/Subdatum engine** — structure-context cache (per-request-safe), lazy data, subdatum + dataframe id_key; match resolved output for portals/relations.
5. **API dispatch + auth/security** — routing, allowlists, new native auth, CSRF-equiv, permissions, all sanitization chokepoints.
6. **Component/area/tool/widget/button models** — ontology-driven, per model, using PHP `_json.php`/search traits as specs; parity-test each component's context+data+search+export.
7. **Client seam** — copy client JS/CSS; adapt only the RQO/SQO-building + API-call layer to the modernized contract; keep views/CSS untouched.
8. **AI/RAG/Agent/MCP** — greenfield, last, on the stable typed core.
- **Every phase is parity-gated against the PHP reference.** Prefer differential testing (same input → compare TS vs PHP output) over hand-written expectations wherever feasible. Never silently narrow scope — log what a phase does not yet cover.

## 9b. Multi-agent orchestration (how to execute at scale)

You may — and for a rewrite of this size, *should* — **use sub-agents freely, each with a distinct role**, to parallelize and de-risk the work. Build a solid orchestration foundation before scaling it out:
- **Role specialization.** Spin up focused agents for well-scoped roles, e.g. *explorer/spec-extractor* (read the PHP reference and produce concept specs), *implementer* (write a component/tool/subsystem in TS), *parity-tester* (differential test TS vs PHP), *security-reviewer* (audit against §7 chokepoints), *DB/matrix specialist*, *client-seam adapter*. Give each a crisp remit and the contracts from §3.
- **Solid basements first.** Do not fan out until the shared foundations are stable and agreed: the §3 concept types, the DB/matrix contract, the SQO engine, and the security gates. Parallelize *breadth* (many components/tools) only on top of a settled *core*.
- **Independent, verifiable units.** Prefer parallel work that is isolated and parity-gated (one component/tool per agent, each with its own differential tests) so results can be verified independently and merged without cross-contamination.
- **Adversarial verification.** Have reviewer/verifier agents independently confirm implementer output (correctness + security) before it is accepted — especially for the §7 chokepoints and any cross-request-state risk (§4).
- **Consistency guardrails.** Keep the §2b code-style rules, naming, and contracts uniform across all agents; a synthesis/coherence pass should reconcile divergences. Log any scope an agent did not cover — never silently narrow.

## 10. Definition of done
- Feature-complete versus PHP for §6, verified by parity tests.
- Same DB schema and per-component data structures; both servers coexist on one database safely.
- Security posture equal-or-stronger on all §7 chokepoints; no cross-request state bleed.
- Measurably lower API latency than sequential PHP on representative workloads.
- Runs standalone behind Apache/Nginx over a socket, with its own independent config; the copied client works against it through the adapted call layer.
- RAG/Agent/MCP built fresh in TS, ACL-respecting, or cleanly seamed for a later phase.

## Verification (how the executor proves parity)
- **Differential harness:** drive identical RQO/SQO requests at the running PHP server and the TS server; diff resolved `context`, `data`, `subdatum`, and search results. Reuse the diffusion engine's existing Bun test patterns.
- **DB round-trip:** write a record via TS, read via PHP (and vice-versa); assert byte-identical `data` JSON in the matrix.
- **Security tests:** attempt each bypass the PHP gates block (server-only SQO keys, invalid tipo/lang injection, over-limit, unauthorized action/class, cross-project record access, media without cookie/marker) and confirm they fail closed.
- **Perf:** benchmark parallelized context/subdatum resolution and multi-section search against PHP; record the delta.
