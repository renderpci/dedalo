/**
 * CLIENT TEST RUNNER (headless)
 *
 * Bun port of the PHP reference runner `test/client/puppeteer_runner.js`. Drives
 * the copied vanilla-JS client's Mocha/Chai suites in headless Chrome against the
 * TS server, so the browser-level client tests become a repeatable one-shot /
 * CI gate — complementing the server-side differential gates under `test/parity/`.
 *
 * How it works (identical control flow to the PHP runner):
 *   1. Launch headless Chrome and open the test runner page
 *      (`/dedalo/test/client/index.html`, served by src/server.ts under /dedalo/*).
 *   2. If `page_globals.is_logged !== true`, AUTHENTICATE. Two paths:
 *      - `cookie` (DEFAULT) — call `login()` (core/security/auth.ts) IN THIS
 *        PROCESS with the configured test credentials and inject the resulting
 *        session (and media-auth) cookie into the browser. Same password check,
 *        same session row, same audit line as a real login: the only thing
 *        skipped is the FORM. It is skipped because the form path is flaky on
 *        a dev box (the two-step reveal loses the submit and the wait times
 *        out), and a gate nobody can run is not a gate.
 *      - `form` (`--auth form`) — type into the copied client's own login form,
 *        the original path. Keep it: it is the only thing that exercises the
 *        client's login UI against TS auth/CSRF.
 *      - `mint` (`--auth mint`) — DEV ONLY, NO PASSWORD: mint a session for an
 *        EXISTING username straight through the session store. For the case
 *        the other two cannot serve — a dev DB whose `DEDALO_TEST_PASSWORD` is
 *        stale (a restored production dump carries ITS passwords, not the
 *        .env one), where a gate that refuses to run teaches nothing. It is
 *        never the default and prints a banner every run: a green run under
 *        `mint` has NOT exercised authentication.
 *   3. Click "run all" (`#test_run_all`), poll until the button re-enables, then
 *      scrape `window.global_stats` + per-group DOM stats.
 *   4. Exit on the verdict of scripts/lib/client_gate_verdict.ts (`conclude`
 *      below is the ONE exit, shared with `--replay`): 0 iff the inventory
 *      floor is met, no card was loaded twice or ran nothing, no pending
 *      suites, and no failure outside KNOWN_FAILING (the disclosed, shrink-only
 *      baseline below) — a suite in that list that now PASSES is also red, so
 *      the list can never outlive the bug it names.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a `bun test` file: it needs a live server + a real
 * browser, so it stays out of the `bunfig.toml` (root=test) discovery and is run
 * explicitly via `bun run test:client`.
 *
 * THE SERVER IS THE RUN'S OWN, ON THE SUITE DATABASE (2026-08-19). This runner
 * used to drive whatever `bun run dev` was already serving — which is the
 * APPLICATION's database by default, so the reseed, the demo-ontology fixture
 * and ~125 browser suites wrote into real records. It now starts its own server
 * on the dedicated suite database and tears it down, and it VERIFIES the target
 * over the wire before Chrome is launched (`/health` must answer the
 * fingerprint of the same `dedalo_test_marker` row this process reads). The
 * mechanism, the alternatives weighed, and the refusal live in
 * scripts/client_test_server.ts. `--url` still points at a server you started
 * yourself — it is checked exactly the same way, never trusted.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/client_test_runner.ts [options]
 *
 * Options (env var fallback in parens):
 *   --url <url>        Runner page of a server YOU started (TEST_URL) — verified
 *                      to be on the suite database like any other target
 *   --port <n>         Port for the run's own server     (default 4390, next free)
 *   --auth <mode>      cookie (default) | form   (TEST_AUTH)
 *   --timeout <ms>     Max run wait, ms          (TEST_TIMEOUT; default 300000)
 *   --headless <bool>  Headless                  (HEADLESS; default true)
 *   --user <username>  Login username            (DEDALO_TEST_USER, else PHP_API_USERNAME)
 *   --password <pwd>   Login password            (DEDALO_TEST_PASSWORD, else PHP_API_PASSWORD)
 *   --no-reseed        Skip the canonical test3 reseed before/after the run
 *   --strict           Treat EVERY failure as red, ignoring KNOWN_FAILING
 *   --update           After a GREEN run, bank the observed inventory (suites,
 *                      mocha tests RAN, static assertion-free it() count, static
 *                      switched-off registration count) into
 *                      engineering/client_gate_inventory.json. REFUSES to lower
 *                      a floor or raise a budget (scripts/lib/client_gate_verdict.ts).
 *   --replay <file>    NO browser, NO server: read a scraped observation
 *                      (a ScrapedRun — {cards: [{status, dataset}], counters,
 *                      groups}, exactly what the page scrape returns) from a
 *                      JSON file and run the SAME interpret-conclude-exit tail — the
 *                      subprocess leg client_gate_inventory_tripwire uses to
 *                      prove this process exits on the verdict, not around it.
 *
 * Credentials are read via the project env loader (src/config/env.ts), so they
 * resolve from ../private/.env exactly like the rest of the config — no secret
 * ever needs to be passed on the command line.

 * (!) Measure the baseline WITH the reseed. A hand-driven run against a polluted

 *
 * This list is a LEDGER, not a mute button:
 *  - a failure NOT listed here is red (that is the whole point of the gate);
 *  - a suite listed here that PASSES is ALSO red — fix the bug, delete the row,

 *    turns into a blanket.
 *  - `--strict` ignores the list entirely (every failure red), for the day the
 *    last row goes.
 *
 * These are client/server bugs, not runner problems; each needs its own change.
 * Do NOT add a row to get a run green — a row costs the same reading as the fix.
