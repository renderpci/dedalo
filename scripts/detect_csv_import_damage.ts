/**
 * ============================================================================
 * DETECT CSV IMPORT DAMAGE — a STRICTLY READ-ONLY scan for the DATA-04/DATA-09
 * corruption signatures (audit 2026-08-26, remediation P0-5)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The parser and the decoder are fixed. This answers the question the fix does
 * NOT: is the damage already in this installation's records? The audit could not
 * answer it — only the suite database was available to it — so the maintainer
 * runs this against the real database, and it is built so that running it is
 * never a risk.
 *
 * WHAT IT LOOKS FOR
 *
 *   A. REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS (DATA-09). Any stored value containing U+FFFD.
 *      Every ingest door decoded uploads as UTF-8 with `fatal:false`, so a
 *      CP1252 file (what Excel writes back over a BOM-less export of ours) had
 *      each accented byte replaced, irreversibly, with a green report.
 *
 *   B. ABSORBED FILE TAIL (DATA-04, the odd-quote case). A `"` anywhere in a
 *      field opened an enclosure that nothing closed, so the delimiter, the row
 *      terminator and the whole remainder of the file were absorbed into ONE
 *      cell. The signature is a SINGLE-LINE literal (the `string` column: input
 *      text and friends) holding an embedded newline — usually with `;` in it
 *      and hundreds of characters long.
 *
 *   C. QUOTE CHARACTERS DELETED (DATA-04, the even-quote case). `Alfonso X "el
 *      Sabio"` parsed with the right row and column count and simply lost its
 *      quotes. There is no trace of that in the value itself — the only witness
 *      is the TIME MACHINE: an import-era version whose previous value differs
 *      from the current one ONLY by its quote characters.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DETECT — read this before you conclude "we are clean":
 *
 *   - Quote deletion on a record that was CREATED by the import, or imported
 *     without time-machine history: nothing in the database ever held the
 *     quoted form, so no query can recover it. Only the source CSV can.
 *     Signature C sees the UPDATE case with history, and nothing else.
 *   - The records the odd-quote case silently NEVER IMPORTED. Absence leaves no
 *     row. Compare the source file's row count with the run's dd800 report.
 *   - Encoding damage where the replacement already round-tripped through
 *     another edit, or where the mis-decode produced a VALID character rather
 *     than U+FFFD (a Latin-1 → UTF-8 double encoding, e.g. `Ã¨` for `è`, which
 *     is legal text; this scan reports the `Ã©/Ã¨/Â` mojibake shape separately
 *     as a HINT, not as proof).
 *   - Whether a suspicious value came from a CSV import at all. Signature B
 *     flags any single-line literal holding a newline — a paste through the UI
 *     produces the same shape. Every hit is a CANDIDATE for a human to judge.
 *   - Anything outside the standard matrix record tables (MATRIX_TABLE_ALLOWLIST).
 *
 * READ-ONLY, AND IT PROVES IT. The scan runs inside one `BEGIN READ ONLY`
 * transaction, and before scanning it VERIFIES the barrier twice: Postgres must
 * report `transaction_read_only = on`, and an attempted write must be REFUSED by
 * the server (error 25006). If either check does not come back as expected the
 * script refuses to scan and exits non-zero — it never trusts its own good
 * intentions. Every statement it runs is printed with its results.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *     bun scripts/detect_csv_import_damage.ts              # scan, summary + samples
 *     bun scripts/detect_csv_import_damage.ts --samples 5  # samples per finding (default 3)
 *     bun scripts/detect_csv_import_damage.ts --queries    # print every query, then scan
