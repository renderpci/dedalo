/**
 * Build the DEDICATED TEST DATABASE (`bun run test:db:setup`).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `bun test` used to run against whatever database the install was
 * configured with, which made the suite depend on that install's data — and let it WRITE
 * to the app's database. Both bit us:
 *   - on a fresh install 183 of 2039 unit tests failed: ~46 files need the `numisdata`
 *     ontology (a project TLD that ships in NO install seed), others read records of the
 *     old shared dev DB;
 *   - a gate provisioning a scratch ontology node DELETED a real one (test218) on its way
 *     out of the LIVE database.
 * Tests now get their own database. The application's is not theirs to touch.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUILDS — a COMPLETE install, from files vendored in this repo, never by copying
 * a live database:
 *   1. the install seed (install/db/dedalo_install.pgsql.gz) — schema + canonical test3;
 *   2. the REFERENCED hierarchies via the installer's own installHierarchies()
 *      — the tools/tree/virtual-section gates need them. NOT all 150 vendored
 *      `<tld>1.copy.gz` files: that glob made the fixture 7612 MB, 97.6% of it
 *      geography no test names (measured 2026-08-25 — 2,267,790 geo
 *      matrix_hierarchy rows deriving 13.9M relation-index and 5.6M
 *      string-search rows). The installed set is `imports` DERIVED from the
 *      test tree by scripts/lib/hierarchy_allowlist.ts (2 TLDs after the
 *      consumer-gate migration onto the step-5c SYNTHETIC hierarchies,
 *      2026-08-25; over-inclusive by design — see that header) — `lg` (the
 *      engine-hardwired languages thesaurus, 21,705 rows) is the permanent
 *      floor, `ad` (10 rows) is held by tier1_install_native's literal
 *      filename. The other vendored files STAY in the repo: a full install
 *      still needs them. Measured 2026-08-25 with this composition
 *      (ad+lg imports + the 1,312 generated synthetic rows):
 *      pg_database_size = 233 MB (244,586,175 bytes), rebuild ~40-45 s;
 *   3. the registered tools, via the installer's own registerInstallTools();
 *   4. the generic `test` TLD ontology, materialized from
 *      src/core/test_data/test_tld_ontology.json through the engine's doors
 *      (records → rebuildOntology), so the suite runs on the REVIEWABLE source
 *      and not on whatever the binary seed happens to hold;
 * It installs NO installation's ontology. It used to load one
 * (`test/fixtures/ontology/numisdata_ontology.copy.gz`) because ~46 gates
 * needed that install's definitions to resolve against; the generic-`test`-TLD
 * migration replaced every one of them with a `test` clone, and that step was
 * dropped on 2026-08-21 after measuring that its absence moves nothing (see
 * below). The fixture FILE stays in the repo — it is the input
 * `scripts/clone_into_test_tld.ts` reads to mint twins, and deleting it would
 * make future cloning impossible from a clone of this repo. It is simply no
 * longer poured into the test database.
 *
 * DEFINITIONS, NOT RECORDS. Every step above installs ONTOLOGY (and the tool
 * registry an install cannot boot without). No fixture RECORDS are seeded here
 * beyond the seed's own — in particular NOT the derived test corpus
 * (src/core/test_data/test_corpus/): that is a situation, and ambient records
 * change the answer for every census, emptiness and row-count gate in the
 * suite. A gate that needs the corpus ensures and drops it itself; see step 6
 * at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * The ontology fixture carries NO `id` column, so ids come from the sequence and cannot
 * collide with the seed's own rows.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS: the env is repointed at the test DB BEFORE src/config/config.ts is ever
 * imported (it freezes the connection at import), so the installer code below — which
 * resolves its connection from the config — targets the test database and nothing else.
 *
 * Re-runnable: it drops and rebuilds. It refuses to run when the test database name
 * resolves to the application's, so a fat-fingered env cannot drop your install.
 *
 * AND IT STAMPS THE DATABASE. Right after CREATE DATABASE + seed restore it
 * writes the `dedalo_test_marker` row (step 2b, src/core/test_data/test_database_marker.ts).
 * That row — not this script's name check, and not the `_test` suffix — is what
 * every test-data writer in the tree asks before it moves a single row. This is
 * the ONLY producer of that row anywhere.
 *
 * AND THE VECTOR DATABASE (P1-16, 2026-08-30). `ragSql` is a SEPARATE pool on a
 * SEPARATE database, outside `assertTestDatabase()` and outside the media
 * marker, and it resolved to the INSTALLATION's semantic index. This command
 * now DROPS and rebuilds `<suite db>_rag` beside the matrix database and the
 * media tree — schema from the vendored install/db/rag_embeddings.sql, stamped
 * with its own `dedalo_test_rag_marker` row — and `bun test` is pointed at it by
 * test/preload/rag_db.ts. Three surfaces, one fixture, one rebuild.
 *
 * AND A READ-ONLY ROLE. Step 5b ensures `dedalo_test_ro` — a LOGIN role with
 * SELECT-only access to this database, for the shard bands that never write.
 * Created idempotently on every rebuild, ONLY behind the guards above (never
 * as a convenience step that runs first), and re-granted after every
 * DROP/CREATE, because the per-database grants and default privileges die with
 * the dropped database — re-issuing them here is what keeps the role from
 * dangling half-granted between rebuilds. Its password is a fixed, committed
 * literal ON PURPOSE: the database it can read is disposable by its own
 * declaration (the marker row), so the credential protects nothing — but the
 * role MUST have one, because config.db carries exactly one user/password pair
 * (src/core/db/postgres.ts buildSqlOptions) and a password-less role would
 * ride this Mac's local `trust` pg_hba and then fail in CI, where the service
 * container forces scram over TCP — green locally, broken where nobody looks.
 *
 * IT REFUSES SHARD CLONES. A third name guard (below, beside the other two)
 * rejects any target matching /__shard\d+$/: the shard workflow teaches
 * developers to export DEDALO_TEST_DATABASE at a clone, and a clone PASSES the
 * app-DB name guard (it only compares against the install's name) and passes
 * the provenance guard's 'marked' branch — precisely BECAUSE the clone's
 * marker was rewritten to name it. Without this guard a leftover export turns
 * `bun run test:db:setup` into a ~15-minute rebuild of a shard-named database
 * and a multi-GiB write aimed at the wrong target. Shards are CLONED from the
 * template, never built directly.

// GUARD 2 of 2 — PROVENANCE (coverage plan §4.4 D13, closed 2026-08-25).
//
// The name guard above is a claim ABOUT a database; this one asks the database
// itself. Three states may proceed:
//   ABSENT   — nothing to lose; the build creates it fresh.
//   MARKED   — it carries the marker row naming ITSELF with the exact purpose
//              sentence, i.e. a database THIS script built (step 2b below is
//              that row's only producer in the tree). Disposable by its own
//              declaration.
//   --force  — the operator overrides an existing-but-unproven target, by name.
// Anything else — a second checkout's install, a colleague's database, a
// production restore sitting at the configured name — REFUSES, having touched
// nothing.
//
// MECHANICS THAT ARE LOAD-BEARING, not style:
//  - Asked over this script's own short-lived psql subprocesses, NEVER the
//    engine pool: importing the marker module would connect postgres.ts's
//    module-scope pool to the target, and a held session makes the very
//    DROP DATABASE this gate protects fail with "being accessed by other
//    users". Each probe has fully exited before the DROP runs.
//  - The table name and purpose sentence come from the marker's DB-FREE
//    constants module, so this file never types the literal (rule 5 of
//    test_db_marker_tripwire scans scripts/ for it).
//  - Values reach SQL as psql variables (:'db', :'purpose'), never spliced into
//    the statement: the purpose sentence is 200 characters of prose and the one
//    honest way to compare it is to let psql quote it. The statements go in on
//    STDIN (-f -) rather than -c, because psql interpolates variables only when
//    lexing file/stdin input — with -c the `:'db'` arrives at the server
//    literally and it is a syntax error. Verified against psql 18 before use.
//  - FAIL-CLOSED by shape: a probe that ERRORS throws (ON_ERROR_STOP + exit
//    code) and aborts the run. Only a SUCCESSFUL empty result means "absent",
//    so a surprise can over-refuse but never over-drop.

// 4. The numisdata TEST ontology — definitions only, no records.

// The vendored `numisdata` ontology fixture was REMOVED here on 2026-08-21,
// the step this file always said phase 5/6 would delete. It existed because
// ~46 gates needed one installation's ontology to resolve against; after the
// generic-`test`-TLD migration the census is 2 files, both unmigratable by
// construction and neither needing this.
//
// MEASURED, not assumed, before deleting: the whole tier was run with the 1537
// ontology rows present and again with them dropped. Parity was identical
// (263 pass / 105 fail both ways) and exactly ONE unit assertion moved —
// observer_seed_native's "every declared peer is dd621 MULTIDIRECTIONAL",
// whose `>= 2` floor reached its count only because this fixture happened to
// be here. It now floors on the GENERIC peers, so it states the same law
// without requiring an installation's ontology to be in the database.

// 5. Hierarchies + tools, through the INSTALLER'S OWN code paths, from repo-vendored data —
// the tools/tree/virtual-section gates need a complete install, not a bare seed.
//
// NOT the whole vendored set. This used to glob every `*1.copy.gz` (153 TLDs,
// 127 MB gzipped) — which is how the fixture reached 7612 MB, 97.6% of it one
// install's geography no test names (see the header). The set is DERIVED from
// the tests' own references by scripts/lib/hierarchy_allowlist.ts — same
// installer path, same vendored files, over-inclusive where uncertain, and
// LOUD if the scan comes back empty. The derivation is exported so a gate can
// hold the installed set equal to the referenced set: a new test naming a new
// TLD reddens the fixture rather than failing mysteriously on one machine.

// the volume + term-text-distribution corpus the search gates need
// (~1,300 rows, derived from the SEARCH_LATE_ROW_LOOKUP_OFFSET default at
// seed time), hierarchy B the second registry pairing (~10 rows). This is the

// 5b. THE READ-ONLY ROLE for the DB-free shard bands (see the header). Sits

// grants and default privileges just died with the DROP above and are
// re-issued in full, so a rebuild can never leave the role half-granted.
//
// The password is a FIXED, COMMITTED literal, deliberately not a secret: the
// only database it can read declares itself disposable (the marker row). It
// exists because the role must authenticate the same way everywhere — a
// password-less role rides local `trust` pg_hba and fails under CI's scram —
// and because config.db carries exactly one user/password credential pair.
// ALTER ROLE re-asserts LOGIN + the password every run, so drift heals.

// sections) is a SITUATION, and this database is the empty stage every gate
// builds its situation on: ambient rows are not free, because a census gate, a
// scratch-surface emptiness check and a "count the rows this save appended"
// assertion all read whatever the database holds. So a gate that needs the
// corpus calls `ensureTestCorpus(scope)` in its own `beforeAll` and
// `dropTestCorpus(scope)` in `afterAll` (test/unit/test_corpus_fixture.test.ts
// is the reference; test/helpers/zzd_diffusion_fixture.ts is the same pattern
// for the diffusion ontology). The generic `test` ontology above is the
// opposite case and does
// belong here: definitions cost nothing to have present, records do — but they
// must be the REPO's definitions, never a copy of some installation's.

//   bun -e "await (await import('./src/core/test_data/test_corpus/ensure.ts')).ensureTestCorpus()"
