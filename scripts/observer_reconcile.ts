/**
 * ============================================================================
 * OBSERVER MIRROR RECONCILE SWEEP — CLI shell over
 * core/section/record/observer_reconcile.ts (the shared kernel; the v6→v7
 * data-update pipeline runs the same kernel automatically in its success
 * tail — update/engine.ts).
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Observer mirrors (the hierarchy93 ← rsc387 family: a term record's
 * "who references me" slot, kept SEARCHABLE by persisting it) are maintained
 * by the save-chokepoint observer cascade. Writes that bypass every cascade
 * door leave them stale: v6→v7 migrated/updated data (the reported case —
 * dc1 §2 had 3 rsc387 referencers and a NULL hierarchy93 mirror, zero TM
 * rows), the delete_data wipe, tool_propagate_component_data, portalize.
 *
 * The kernel replays the ONE recompute law (recomputeExternalRelation —
 * row-locked, order-preserved keep, next-id append, TM audit pair) per
 * candidate: referenced targets from matrix_relation_index (trigger truth)
 * ∪ stored-mirror holders, host sections from spec ∪ index truth.
 *
 * USAGE (dry-run is the default and prints every drifted record):
 *
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts --observer hierarchy93 --section dc1
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts --id 2 --section dc1
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts --apply
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts --json > census.json
 *     bun scripts/observer_reconcile.ts --budget            # non-zero exit if busted
 *
 * SINCE 2026-08-06 THE SWEEP APPLIES THE FULL LAW, drops included. The
 * grow-only fail-safe (and its `--allow-shrink` opt-in) is GONE: its premise
 * — that the computed set was known too small — expired when the D3 closure
 * landed, and a mirror that can only grow is not a mirror. The one remaining
 * shrink escape is derived by the kernel: a record whose SEED was degraded
 * (missing peer ontology node, malformed peer locator) keeps its drops and
 * says so. Fix the ontology it names, then re-run.
 *
 * THE CENSUS. `--json` emits one line per drifted record
 * {observerTipo, hostSection, sectionId, before, after, dropped, added,
 * seedDefects?, refusal?} so drop volume can be audited BY CAUSE. `--budget`
 * adjudicates the run against engineering/observer_shrink_budget.json and
 * exits non-zero when the corpus wants to delete more than the declared
 * ceiling — a re-runnable pre-deploy check, so a future value-law change that
 * would mass-delete fails here rather than at the next save.
 *
 * UNPORTED SUB-LAWS: observers whose source carries `set_observed_data` /
 * `source_overwrite` (PHP sub-laws a/b, not ported) are REFUSED wholesale
 * and reported as such — law (c) is provably the wrong law for them
 * (numisdata679/965 would wipe ~131,800 mirror locators).
