/**
 * MARIADB TIER — the blocking stage that proves every MariaDB-bound gate RAN, against
 * the SUITE's own MariaDB, and that EACH gate's own writes landed there (PUB-05, audit
 * 2026-09-26).
 *
 *   bun run scripts/ci/mariadb_tier.ts          # run the set, print faults, exit 1 on any
 *
 * WHY A STAGE OF ITS OWN. Before PUB-05 the diffusion integration gates decided at
 * import time whether to run (`HAVE_DB`, `AVAILABLE`, `test.if`, a `*_difftest` schema
 * discovery). On a runner without the installation's socket they skipped GREEN; on a
 * developer machine with one they wrote into the installation's publication database
 * (`web_numisdata_mib`). Both are the same defect seen from two sides: the target was
 * borrowed from the machine instead of built by the suite. The unit baseline could not
 * see it — its per-file floors were recorded on a machine where the gates ran, against
 * the installation.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED (outcomes, never spellings):
 *   1. the SET — every test/integration file, minus the shrink-only INSTALL_BOUND_EXEMPT
 *      rows, plus every test/unit AND test/parity file that IMPORTS test/helpers/suite_mariadb.ts at
 *      runtime (Bun's own transpiler resolves the imports: type-only imports are erased,
 *      dynamic ones count). Floor: MARIADB_TIER_FILE_FLOOR files.
 *   1b. THE NO-CONTACT POPULATION — every test/unit AND test/parity file OUTSIDE the set
 *      whose RUNTIME import closure reaches `src/diffusion/targets/mariadb/db.ts` (the
 *      module that opens MariaDB pools) is RUN, in one armed batch with the suite server
 *      up, and the suite
 *      user's CONTACTS with that server (connections opened + refused, USER_STATISTICS)
 *      must not move. The population is DERIVED, never listed: static and literal dynamic
 *      imports, followed transitively through test/helpers, src and tools, plus the
 *      reasoned SEAM_EDGES of the product modules that import by a COMPUTED path (a
 *      product module with such an import and no row is red). A gate that opens a pool
 *      without acquiring is thereby measured, not trusted: armed, it lands on the suite
 *      server as the suite user; a non-zero batch is re-run file by file and each file
 *      that contacted is named with its import chain. Every population file must RUN
 *      ≥1 case — reported, not all skipped, and ≥1 `expect` executed (a file whose
 *      `beforeAll` threw reports ONE failed '(unnamed)' case and 0 assertions: it never
 *      reached the code that could open a pool, so it proves nothing) — unless a
 *      reasoned, shrink-only NO_CONTACT_IDLE row says why it runs nothing by
 *      construction (a row whose file now runs, or left the population, is red);
 *      partial skips are printed, not judged; its pass/fail is the unit / parity tier's
 *      verdict, not this stage's. A population file that ACQUIRES (through a wrapper
 *      helper) is red too: the set must derive it. Floors: NO_CONTACT_POPULATION_FLOOR
 *      (test/unit) and NO_CONTACT_PARITY_FLOOR (test/parity).
 *      WHY test/parity (review 2026-09-30, measured). The preload arms EVERY `bun test`
 *      process, parity included, and 37 test/parity files reach the pool module
 *      transitively (count_differential, widgets_differential, ts_mutations_differential…).
 *      Holding only test/unit left that half of the class declared, not measured. Parity
 *      replays the frozen fixture store, credless, so it runs in the same batch — AFTER
 *      the parity tier measured its own verdict (db_tier.sh runs this stage last).
 *      NOT CLOSED HERE, said so: a contact that happens only in a situation the suite
 *      database does not hold is not made on this run; a test-side computed import is not
 *      followed; and a developer run with the lane server DOWN still falls back to the
 *      installation's TCP server — PUB-05b closes that for every caller.
 *   2. per file, from bun's own JUnit counts: it REPORTED, ran >0 cases, SKIPPED NONE,
 *      failed none, and executed >0 `expect` calls. `skipped === 0` per file is what
 *      closes the partial skip — one `test.if(false)` leg in an otherwise green file.
 *   3. per helper-importing file, an ACQUISITION row in the ledger the helper appends
 *      only after the marker read named THIS lane: the file really reached the suite
 *      server, not some other one.
 *   4. PER FILE, the ROWS THE SUITE USER CHANGED on this server while THAT file ran
 *      (`information_schema.USER_STATISTICS` for `dedalo_test_diffusion`: rows
 *      inserted, deleted, updated) match the file's declared ROW_CONTRACT — every
 *      counter it declares rises; a file declared row-less moves none. So each writer
 *      gate proves ITS OWN writes landed on the suite server.
 *
 * WHY PER FILE (review 2026-09-30). The second version diffed the counters once around
 * the whole set, and the set contains suite_mariadb_target_native — the gate that
 * exercises this very measure by inserting and deleting rows of its own. So the
 * aggregate rose whenever that one gate passed, whatever the product gates wrote: leg 4
 * could not go red while it was green. Each file now runs in its own `bun test` and is
 * judged on its own window; no file's writes can stand in for another's.
 *
 * WHY TRANSITIVE AND MEASURED (review 2026-09-30). The previous leg 1b took ONE hop on
 * each side — db.ts plus its direct src importers, against each test's direct imports —
 * and held the five files it found with reasoned NO_CONTACT rows that nothing measured.
 * Measured with the stage's own scanner: 130 test/unit files reached db.ts transitively
 * and were neither in the set nor held (e.g. reconcile_registry_native → core/reconcile/
 * catalog → a dynamic import of diffusion/api/reconcile → public_tier_reconcile →
 * getTargetPool). The rows are gone; the closure is derived and its outcome measured.
 *
 * WHY PER-USER ROWS, NOT `Com_*` (review 2026-09-30, measured). The first version diffed
 * the global `Com_insert`/`Com_create_table`/`Com_delete`. Those count statements
 * DISPATCHED, by anyone, whatever they did: the helper's own root provisioning (a no-op
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, a 0-row `DELETE`, an `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY`) and the
 * self-check's REFUSED insert (errno 1142) each raised them by one, and every child
 * `bun test` runs both once. Rows changed BY THE DIFFUSION USER exclude root and exclude
 * refused statements.
 *
 * THE MEASURE IS CALIBRATED ON EVERY RUN, live. Before the set, two planted one-file runs
 * go through the same runner: one whose gate only ACQUIRES (the whole harness: ensure,
 * provisioning, self-check, marker read) must move every counter by EXACTLY 0; one whose
 * gate also inserts, updates and deletes one row must move each by > 0. A measure that
 * counts the harness, or is blind to a write, is a RED — so leg 4 can never pass by
 * construction. Leg 1b's contact measure has its own pair: a planted file that imports
 * the pool module and opens nothing must move the contacts by EXACTLY 0; one that opens a
 * pool WITHOUT acquiring (after proving it is armed at a live suite socket, so it can
 * never take the TCP fallback) must move them by > 0 — which also proves the runner's
 * child is ARMED: an unarmed child would contact some other server, and read 0 here. A measure that cannot be READ (userstat off, the server gone) is a
 * structured fault in the same report, never an uncaught stack.
 *
 * NOTHING RUNS UNTIL THE SUITE SERVER EXISTS. The set is handed to `bun test` only after
 * `ensureSuiteMariadb()` answered; a missing helper or a server that will not start is
 * a refusal BEFORE any file runs, so this stage can never be the thing that drives the
 * gates at the installation's socket. Arming itself is the preload's job
 * (test/preload/suite_mariadb.ts); this stage deliberately does NOT export the suite
 * env to its child, so a preload that stops arming is caught here too (the files'
 * `requireSuiteMariadb` refuses, the counts go red) instead of being papered over.
 *
 * Everything is injectable (`runMariadbTier({ runner, helper, listing })`) so the whole
 * stage — not only its pure halves — is held by planted controls in
 * test/unit/suite_mariadb_target_native.test.ts.
