# INSTANCE CI TIER — the gates that BOOT A REAL SERVER over the wire, on a HOSTED
# runner: the browser client suite, the two code-update drills, the
# publication-host media drill (live Apache + nginx), the publication-host
# agent drill (the real agent over mTLS, live Apache + nginx, real v2 releases)
# and the publication-host engine drill (engine ↔ real agent: pair CLI, panel, httpd).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Three commands the repo relies on ran on NO executing CI:
# scripts/ci/client_gate.sh (the 133-suite browser gate), `bun run test:update`
# and `bun run test:update:dev`. Each was invoked only from
# .github/workflows-selfhosted/, a directory GitHub does not read on a public repo
# (rule 5 of test/unit/ci_workflow_tripwire.test.ts — a self-hosted job there is
# RCE on the data host). "Wired" meant "never reached" (P0-1 residual, GATE-02/03/
# 14/15 of the 2026-08-26 deep audit). This script is their executing home; the
# `instance` job of .github/workflows/db.yml runs it on every PR and every push to
# master/v7, and test/unit/tier_wiring_tripwire.test.ts holds that wiring.
#
# WHY A TIER OF ITS OWN, and not two more stages of db_tier.sh. Every gate here
# STARTS A SERVER PROCESS on a port and drives it through HTTP — a browser, a code
# master, a supervised consumer that restarts itself mid-run. The db tier runs
# in-process gates. Different footprint (Chrome, zip/unzip, ~3 GB of TMPDIR for the
# consumer copy, network for the drill's quarantine `bun install`), different
# failure modes (a port, a socket path, a wedged child), and — decisive — a FRESH
# suite database: the db tier's 725-file unit stage pollutes the fixture it shares
# with everything after it (matrix_users grows with every full run, and the client
# baseline was measured on a clean fixture: AGENTS.md, "ALWAYS measure with the
# reseed on"). A second job with its own service container is that isolation.
#
# WHAT IT SHARES WITH THE DB TIER, by `source`: the whole composed environment
# (scripts/ci/hosted_env.sh — the required keys, the
# fixture-harvest configuration, the seam tables, the Postgres client path). One
# copy, so the two tiers cannot drift; the rules that pin it follow the `source`.
#
# NO `secrets.` REACHES THIS TIER — the same fork-safety property as db_tier.sh.
# THIS SCRIPT MUST NOT CALL hermetic.sh, for the reason db_tier.sh states.
#
# THE UPDATE DRILLS ON A RUNNER. scripts/update_drill.ts used to copy
# ../private/.env into the consumer's private dir and boot the master off the
# checkout's own file — a runner has neither. The drill now composes both from
# scripts/lib/operator_config.ts: the file if present, overlaid by the CATALOG
# keys of the process environment — never PATH, HOME or a runner's GITHUB_TOKEN
# (test/unit/update_drill_config_tripwire.test.ts asserts the negative).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ci/instance_tier.sh   (from anywhere; cd's to repo root)
#
# Locally, run it the way the runner does — `bun run ci:local --instance` — and
# on macOS with `TMPDIR=/tmp/dd`: the drills bind unix sockets under TMPDIR and
# macOS caps that path at 104 bytes (AGENTS.md, test:update).

# dispatchers (ci/Dockerfile), which run the drill's stand-ins accepting only its closed
# argv — no real sudo or systemctl exists to be reached. v2's /health needs a database:
# the suite MariaDB's zzd target, so this stage starts that server and the EXIT trap
# stops it (tier_wiring_tripwire leg J). openssl, apxs, nginx, MariaDB or the seam
# missing is RED, never a skip.

# (published 200 / unpublished 404), probe, rollback_api of real v2 releases, and
# the refusals (non-root admin, re-provisioned agent, frozen/dead agent, corrupt
