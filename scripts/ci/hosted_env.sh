# HOSTED ENVIRONMENT — the configuration every hosted tier that needs a database
# composes IN-PROCESS. Sourced, never executed.
#
# ONE COPY. scripts/ci/db_tier.sh composed this block itself, and the day a second
# hosted tier needed the same database (scripts/ci/instance_tier.sh: the gates that
# BOOT a real server over the wire — the browser suite and the two update drills)
# the block would have been duplicated, and the two copies would have drifted the
# way every hand-maintained pair in this repo has drifted. So the block moved here
# and both tiers `source` it. The rules that pin it (ci_workflow_tripwire rules 6,
# 6b, 13) follow `source` lines, so what they held over db_tier.sh they hold over
# the sourced text of every hosted tier.
#
# Every value is exported HERE rather than written into a ../private/.env, so what
# the runner sees is visible in this file and identical on every runner. Process env
# outranks the file anyway. Externally provided values always win
# (`: "${VAR:=default}"` keeps them), which is how a caller renames its ENTITY or
# points at another Postgres.
#
# NO `secrets.` REACHES ANY HOSTED TIER, and that is the fork-safety property: anyone
# may open a PR, so the workflow gives it its own empty Postgres and nothing more.
#
# Usage:  source scripts/ci/hosted_env.sh   (from the repo root; cd there first)

# Puppeteer is a devDep. The db tier never launches a browser; the instance tier
# launches the SYSTEM Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`, scripts/client_test_runner.ts),
# which ubuntu-latest ships. Never download one on a runner.

# EGRESS ALLOWLIST — because the VENDORED SEED names a host, and this tier composes the
# whole environment itself. install/db/dedalo_install.pgsql.gz ships two sections with an
# `api_config` (`test3` and `rsc205`, both `https://zenon.dainst.org/api/v1/...`), and
# src/external/config.ts refuses an api_config whose api_url host is not allowlisted AT
# PARSE TIME — `fetched` is a property of the FIELD, not of the caller, so nothing has to
# be about to make a request for the refusal to fire.
#
# With the key unset every host is blocked, so `isExternalSectionTipo` THROWS, and
# listExternalSectionTipos turns that into `update.refused` — which is on the Time Machine
# RESTORE path (tools/tool_time_machine, via normalizeRestoredSectionIds). Net effect
# measured 2026-08-31: 14 of the 15 red gates in this tier's first stage, none of them
# about external services at all, and every one green on a developer box where
# ../private/.env happens to carry the same host.
#
# So this is not a permission being granted for convenience: it is the tier declaring the
# egress policy the repo's OWN fixture requires. A new api_config host in the seed belongs
# here too, or the tier goes red the same way.

# composes its whole environment in-process, so a key the developer's ../private/.env
# happens to supply is simply absent here and the comparison diverges. That is not a
# regression and does not belong in engineering/parity_baseline.json: it is this tier
# failing to declare the configuration the repo's own fixtures require, exactly like the
# egress allowlist above.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-31: with the census addressing fixed but these eight unset, the tier
# reports 5 unlisted regressions (382/264/105/13). With them it reports 382/269/100/13 and
