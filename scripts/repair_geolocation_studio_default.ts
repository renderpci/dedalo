/**
 * ============================================================================
 * GEOLOCATION STUDIO-DEFAULT REPAIR — removes the map VIEW the CLIENT
 * fabricated from its factory map position.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * THE RULE THIS SCRIPT IMPLEMENTS (the v6 migration's rule, stated plainly):
 *
 *   - item is ONLY the studio default (no features) → REMOVE it; the record
 *     ends with no geolocation at all.
 *   - item has features and its VIEW is the studio default → FIT THE VIEW TO
 *     THE GEOMETRY: rewrite lat/lon to the bbox centre of the item's own
 *     features. Features, zoom, alt, id and every other key are untouched.
 *   - anything else → UNTOUCHED. `alt` is real data some installs use; it is
 *     removed only as part of removing a default-only item.
 *
 * THE MODEL
 * component_geolocation stores, per item, {id?, lat, lon, zoom, alt?, lib_data?}
 * in the matrix `geo` column. lat/lon/zoom are THE VIEW — the map framing, and
 * nothing more; `lib_data` holds the FEATURES — drawn geometry. The two are
 * INDEPENDENT: features do not determine the view, and a view asserts no
 * feature. An operator pans and zooms to frame the space they need to see, so
 * the useful view is often nowhere near any single feature.
 *
 * WHAT IS BROKEN
 * Until the client fix, the edit view SEEDED self.current_value[0] at render
 * with a hardcoded map centre — the STUDIO DEFAULT, lat 39.462571 /
 * lon -0.376295, the Dédalo facilities' own position shipped as the client's
 * factory map position — and the save button consulted no dirty signal. So
 * merely OPENING a record and pressing save stored a view nobody chose.
 * Publication withholds exactly that pair (isStudioDefault, one door only), but
 * the fabricated view is still in the store, edited and migrated like real data.
 * This script takes it out.
 *
 * This script imports NOTHING from src/diffusion, so it can run before or after
 * any diffusion change; the coordinate normalization it needs is inlined below,
 * for the same reason the studio-default literals are.
 *
 * FITTING THE VIEW IS NOT AUTHORING A LOCATION
 * When a fabricated view sits on an item that carries features, clearing the
 * view would discard framing for work that exists, and keeping it frames the
 * studio instead of the work. So the repair FITS THE VIEW TO THE GEOMETRY: the
 * bbox centre of every feature across the item's lib_data layers. That is what
 * a view is for. It asserts no feature and claims no location — it is the frame
 * the operator would have landed on. For a single drawn Point — the commonest
 * case by far — the fitted view is EXACTLY that point (a one-position bbox has
 * its own coordinate as its centre; the code returns the position verbatim,
 * unrounded, when min === max). If the geometry yields no usable position the
 * item is HELD, never guessed.
 *
 * WHY A SCRIPT, NOT ONE UPDATE
 * The pair alone does not tell you what to DO with an item. A real share of the
 * items whose view is the studio default carry hand-drawn features (a lib_data
 * layer with a non-empty FeatureCollection — e.g. an 11-vertex LineString), and
 * that work must survive the repair. A blanket `WHERE lat = 39.462571` DESTROYS
 * it. The candidate test must inspect lib_data per item — and coordinates are
 * stored MIXED, as strings AND as numbers in the same column, so every
 * comparison normalizes first. The predicates are exported and gated:
 * test/unit/geolocation_studio_default_repair.test.ts.
 *
 * NOT REVERSIBLE — BE HONEST
 * One recordTimeMachine row per repaired component records the TRANSITION. It
 * does NOT make the old value restorable: on the development copy this was
 * built against, matrix_time_machine held NO row carrying the studio default.
 * Do not read that as a guarantee for other installs — assume there is nothing
 * to restore from, and nothing to purge (hence no --purge-tm flag). Removal is
 * irreversible and that is the intent.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * (!) THERE IS NO ACCIDENTAL TRUE POSITIVE
 * ============================================================================
 * 39.462571/-0.376295 is NOT "the city of Valencia". It is the STUDIO DEFAULT:
 * the coordinates of the Dédalo facilities, shipped as the client's factory map
 * position. An item holding EXACTLY that pair is therefore always fabricated —
 * nobody frames a map on the studio to six decimals — and exact equality is a
 * sound fabrication test. A record merely NAMED after the studio's city is
 * fabricated like any other: the pair is a factory default, not a place. There
 * is no place-name test here, and there must never be one again.
 *
 * MODIFIED STAMPS — DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN
 * Every component write through the save pipeline also stamps the record's
 * dd197/dd201 modified-by/modified-date. This repair does NOT, and that is a
 * decision, not an oversight. A mechanical sweep is not an edit: stamping it
 * would overwrite the real curation signal ("who last worked this record, and
 * when") on every repaired record with a bulk timestamp, which is precisely
 * the harm save_component's own `skipModifiedStamp` flag exists to avoid on
 * the import path. The transition IS audited — one matrix_time_machine row per
 * repaired component, attributed to the MANDATORY --user (there is no default:
 * a falsified actor on an irreversible sweep is worse than a refusal to run).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH
 * ============================================================================
 * The ZERO CLUSTER: es1 hierarchy31 items stored at lat 0 / lon 0 (about a
 * thousand on the development copy this was built against — treat the figure as
 * illustrative, not as a population count). That is a SECOND fabrication
 * cluster (Null Island, published through tp_spain), and 0 is a LEGAL
 * coordinate — so it is indistinguishable, mechanically, from a deliberate one.
 * It is NOT in the studio-default predicate and never will be: conflating two
 * fabrications is how the first one stayed hidden for years. It is a separate
 * curatorial decision, ledgered as a known-open gap (rewrite/LEDGER.md,
 * "geolocation zero cluster").
 *
 * SCOPE + SAFETY
 * - `--table` and `--user` are BOTH MANDATORY. There is no "sweep everything"
 *   invocation. Only tables in APPLY_ADJUDICATED accept --apply; every
 *   allowlisted table accepts the read-only dry-run, which is how the evidence
 *   for an adjudication gets gathered.
 * - Tipos come from the ONTOLOGY (dd_ontology model='component_geolocation'),
 *   never a hardcoded list.
 * - HELD, never touched: a default-only item sharing the component with a real
 *   item (MIXED — key removal is all-or-nothing), and features from which no
 *   position can be extracted (NO_POSITION).
 * - Writes go through updateMatrixKeysData(…, 'geo', tipo, …): the `#-`
 *   key-removal form (CLEAR) and the single-key set form (FIT_VIEW) touch ONLY
 *   this component's key, so a concurrent write to another component in the
 *   same column is never clobbered. NEVER updateMatrixRecord.
 * - TOCTOU CLOSED: discovery is an unlocked scan, so the verdict it produces is
 *   a PLAN, never an authority to write. Inside the per-record transaction the
 *   key is re-read under a FOR UPDATE row lock (readMatrixKeyForUpdate) and
 *   adjudicated AGAIN on the freshly locked value; the write uses the locked
 *   items, not the scanned ones. A coordinate committed between the scan and
 *   the write makes the verdict change, and the record is SKIPPED and reported
 *   as "changed under us" — never silently destroyed.
 * - 0 affected rows = the record was deleted underneath us: FAIL LOUD.
 * - After --apply the discovery re-runs and the gate compares held/fitted
 *   IDENTITIES, not counts. Not green ⇒ EXIT 1 (a printed warning is not a gate).
 *
 * USAGE (dry-run is the default; it lists every candidate, fit and hold):
 *
 *     bun scripts/repair_geolocation_studio_default.ts --table matrix --user 1
 *     bun scripts/repair_geolocation_studio_default.ts --table matrix --user 1 --apply
