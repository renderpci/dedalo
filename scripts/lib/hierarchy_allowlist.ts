/**
 * HIERARCHY FIXTURE ALLOWLIST — which vendored `<tld>1.copy.gz` hierarchies the
 * SUITE DATABASE actually needs, DERIVED BY SCANNING THE TEST TREE, never a
 * hand list.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-25). The suite database was 7612 MB, and
 * 97.6% of it was ONE KIND of data nobody asked for: `scripts/test_db_setup.ts`
 * globbed EVERY `*1.copy.gz` in install/import/hierarchy/ — 150 country
 * hierarchies, 127 MB gzipped — and the triggers on matrix_hierarchy then
 * derived 13.9M matrix_relation_index rows (1368 MB) and 5.6M
 * matrix_string_search rows (691 MB) on top of 2,267,790 geo hierarchy rows
 * (5370 MB). Meanwhile the tests only ever NAME a handful of those TLDs, and
 * most references are NAME-ONLY string work (safeExportTipo('es1'),
 * tableForTipo('es1')); exactly one gate declares itself volume-bound
 * (test/unit/search_late_row_lookup.test.ts — es1, "thousands of records").
 * Installing 136 hierarchies no test can name is not coverage, it is a
 * ~7.4 GiB tax on every rebuild of a disposable fixture.
 *
 * THE DERIVATION, not a hand list:
 *  - CANDIDATES are the vendored files themselves (`vendoredHierarchyTlds`):
 *    every `<tld>1.copy.gz` under install/import/hierarchy/. The files STAY in
 *    the repo regardless of this allowlist — deleting them would make a full
 *    install impossible; this module only decides what the SUITE database
 *    installs.
 *  - REFERENCES are found by scanning test/ and src/core/test_data/ (the
 *    situations the suite materializes) for tipo-shaped tokens:
 *      · in .ts files: the hierarchy SECTION tipo itself, `<tld>1` with a
 *        word boundary before and no digit after. Comments COUNT — a comment
 *        recording that an observer's targets are "the country hierarchies
 *        (ad1, al1, …, af1)" is a measured fact about the suite ontology, and
 *        over-inclusion is the safe direction. Requiring the literal `<tld>1`
 *        (not `<tld><digits>`) is what keeps `be32(...)`, `md5`, `pg15` and
 *        `id1`-style identifiers out of the census without a hand blocklist.
 *      · in .json files (fixture manifests, corpus records, the test-TLD
 *        clone maps): ANY quoted tipo in the TLD, `"<tld><digits>"` — JSON
 *        carries no code identifiers, so the looser grammar is safe there and
 *        catches foreign refs like "it3"/"ma5" that never spell `<tld>1`.
 *  - test/parity/fixtures/ is EXCLUDED, deliberately: the frozen oracle store
 *    is opaque harvested payload in which two-letter+digit sequences occur by
 *    accident, and scanning it marks EVERY candidate referenced — i.e. it
 *    reproduces the glob and makes the allowlist vacuous. Parity REQUESTS are
 *    built in the .ts gate files, which ARE scanned.
 *  - A TLD with any hit in either grammar STAYS. Uncertainty resolves toward
 *    keeping: never drop a hierarchy to hit a size target.
 *
 * MEASURED at the derivation's seed (2026-08-25): 14 of 150 TLDs referenced
 * (ad af al cl cu dz ee es fr it lg ma pt tn), 15.0 MB of the 127 MB (11.8%).
 * Same day, after the NAME_ONLY exclusions and the synthetic-fixture landing:
 * `ee it ma pt tn` out (justified by nothing but mapping keys / a refusal
 * ledger / CSS colour literals), and the record VOLUME the imports carried is
 * being replaced by the GENERATED `test*` hierarchies
 * (src/core/test_data/synthetic_hierarchy_fixture.ts, ~1,310 rows) — the
 * remaining geo imports (es fr cl cu ad af al dz) drain out of this derivation
 * as their consumer gates migrate onto the synthetic corpus and their
 * comments are scrubbed; `lg` alone is permanent (engine-hardwired languages
 * thesaurus: select_lang's `lg1`, import_csv's pinned id 17344).
 *
 * CONSUMERS. scripts/test_db_setup.ts installs exactly `imports` (through the
 * installer's own code path, from the same vendored files) and then GENERATES
 * the synthetic hierarchies named in `tlds` beyond it. The generic_tld_tripwire
 * data side reads `tlds` as the set of matrix_hierarchy TLD heads the law
 * admits, so a new test naming a new TLD reddens the fixture until it is
 * rebuilt — the allowlist can drift STALE, never silently NARROW.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, stated plainly:
 *  - It reads SOURCE, not runtime behaviour. A tipo assembled at runtime from
 *    fragments (`tld + '1'`) is invisible to both grammars — that failure mode
 *    UNDER-includes. Audited 2026-08-25: every geo-TLD reference in the tree
 *    is a literal token. The gate over this module is what keeps that audit
 *    from rotting silently.
 *  - Presence in the allowlist proves a NAME was written somewhere, not that
 *    the gate needs the record DATA (most name-only callers would pass on an
 *    empty table). That asymmetry is accepted: over-installing a referenced
 *    hierarchy costs megabytes; under-installing one costs a red gate on
 *    someone else's machine.
 *  - An EMPTY derivation is refused loudly rather than returned: es1 is
 *    provably referenced today, so zero hits means the scan broke, and a
 *    broken scan must never quietly build an empty fixture.

 * FILES WHOSE MENTION OF A TIPO IS A NAME, NOT A NEED.
 *
 * The scan below treats "this tree names `it1`" as "this tree needs `it1`'s
 * records". For source files that is right. For these three it is not, and the
 * difference was measured: the first derived allowlist imported 14 TLDs / 243k
 * thesaurus records, of which `ee it ma pt tn` — 103,536 rows, 42.6% of all
 * hierarchy data — were justified by NOTHING BUT these files.
 *
 *  - `test_tld_clone_manifest.json` and `test_tld_tipo_map.json` are TRANSLATION
 *    TABLES: they say "install tipo `it1` becomes test tipo `testXXX`". The
 *    install tipo appears as a MAPPING KEY. What the suite then reads is the
 *    `test*` twin, which the generic-TLD law requires and which this fixture
 *    materialises from repo-owned JSON — never `it1`'s 69,999 imported records.
 *  - `test_corpus/refused.json` is the ledger of records the corpus derive
 *    REFUSED. Treating it as evidence of need inverts its meaning exactly.
 *  - `test_tld_foreign_refs.json` (added 2026-08-25) is the ledger of
 *    tipo-SHAPED tokens the shipped test ontology carries that are DECLARED
 *    FALSE POSITIVES — its only geo-TLD hits are the CSS colour literals
 *    `#ee9916` and `#ad6738` inside cloned css blobs, each annotated "not an
 *    ontology TLD" in the file itself. Before this exclusion, that colour
 *    literal alone was what kept `ee1` (11,910 real toponymy rows, 720K)
 *    in the suite fixture: a hex colour is not a record need, and counting a
 *    false-positive LEDGER as evidence inverts its meaning the same way
 *    refused.json's did.
 *  - `test_corpus/test2827.json` and `test_corpus/test2822.json` (added
 *    2026-08-25, the synthetic-fixture migration's last census hits): DERIVED
 *    corpus files whose ONLY vendored-TLD tokens are PROVENANCE metadata —
 *    `source_section_tipo: "es1"` / `"dz1"` and the matching `source` blocks
 *    record which install record a `test*` twin was derived FROM. The suite
 *    reads the twin (`test2827`/`test2822` rows in matrix_test), never the
 *    es1/dz1 records — the same "mapping key, not record need" class as the
 *    tipo map. Measured before this entry: these two provenance strings alone
 *    kept `es` (69,889 toponymy rows) and `dz` imported into every rebuild.
 *    Audited: no other corpus file's provenance names a vendored TLD.
 *
 * A tipo named ONLY here is still available to any test that truly wants it —
 * the vendored `.copy.gz` files all stay in the repo. It is simply not poured
 * into the fixture on the strength of a mapping key.
