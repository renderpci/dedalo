/**
 * SHARD DATABASE PROVISIONING — clone, marker-rewrite, drop and sweep for the
 * Phase 3 shard runner (scripts/test_shard.ts).
 *
 * WHY CLONES AND NOT A SHARED DATABASE. The co-location census
 * (scripts/lib/test_components.ts, 2026-08-25) measured ONE dominant connected
 * component of 95 test files welded by TLD-wide destructive drops, whole-corpus
 * `ensureTestCorpus()` calls and the canonical test3 rewriters: two concurrent
 * `bun test` processes on ONE database destroy each other's fixtures
 * non-deterministically. Each shard therefore gets its OWN database, cloned
 * from the suite template.
 *
 * WHY `STRATEGY = FILE_COPY` IS EXPLICIT (server measured: Postgres 18.4). The
 * PG15+ default, WAL_LOG, pushes the whole 7.43 GiB template through the WAL —
 * on a volume at 96% capacity that is the difference between a clone and an
 * outage. A physical file copy also never fires the derivation triggers: the
 * 13.9M `matrix_relation_index` and 5.6M `matrix_string_search` derived rows
 * arrive ALREADY DERIVED, which is exactly why engineering/CI.md's objection
 * to a `pg_dump -Fc` cache (a logical restore re-derives everything) does NOT
 * transfer here.
 *
 * THE MARKER REWRITE IS MANDATORY, NOT COSMETIC. A file copy carries the
 * template's `id = 1` marker row naming the TEMPLATE — on the clone that is the
 * 'misrouted' state `readTestDatabaseMarker()` refuses for EVERY test-data
 * write ("a test-database dump restored somewhere it does not belong"), so an
 * unrewritten clone fails the whole DB tier loudly. The rewrite names the table
 * through `TEST_MARKER_TABLE` from the DB-FREE constants module — never the
 * literal, which `test_db_marker_tripwire` rule 5 forbids outside the marker
 * modules — over a SHORT-LIVED psql subprocess, the same shape as
 * scripts/test_db_setup.ts's provenance probe and for the same two reasons:
 * importing the marker module would connect postgres.ts's module-scope pool,
 * and a held session makes the later DROP fail with "being accessed by other
 * users".
 *
 * SWEEP IS A GUARDED PATH, NOT A PATTERN DROP. Re-deriving disposability from
 * a NAME SHAPE is exactly what this codebase closed on 2026-08-25 ("a name is a
 * claim ABOUT a database; this one asks the database itself" —
 * scripts/test_db_setup.ts guard 2). The sweep enumerates candidates with a
 * fully-escaped LIKE (in LIKE, a bare `_` is a single-char wildcard — an
 * unescaped pattern would enumerate NEIGHBOURING databases), then probes EACH
 * candidate's own marker and drops only the ones that say, themselves, that
 * they are disposable AND name THEMSELVES; anything unmarked / wrong-purpose /
 * misrouted is REFUSED AND NAMED, never dropped. Media twins likewise: a
 * directory under the test-media base is removed only when it carries the
 * `.dedalo_test_media` marker.
 *
 * THREE SURFACES PER SHARD, NOT TWO. A shard child also builds a VECTOR
 * database: `test/preload/rag_db.ts` derives it from the child's own `DB_NAME`,
 * so it is `<template>__shard<N>_rag`, created on the spot. The anchored
 * `__shard<N>` grammar cannot see that name, and `test:db:setup` refuses a shard
 * name outright, so nothing would have dropped it: every shard run WOULD have
 * leaked one vector database for ever. Stated in the conditional deliberately —
 * the vector preload and the sweep landed in the SAME change (2026-08-30), so no
 * such database was ever actually left behind, and the reviewer confirmed none
 * exists on this server. The hazard was designed out before it could happen, not
 * observed and repaired. It is swept HERE, with the clone it
 * belongs to, on the SAME guarded path: the twin's name is DERIVED by the same
 * function the preload uses (`suiteRagDatabaseName`, never a re-typed `_rag`
 * tail), the vector server is the store's own (`DEDALO_RAG_DB_*_CONN` may put it
 * on another host), and the DROP is licensed by the twin's own
 * `dedalo_test_rag_marker` row — `dropSuiteRagDatabase` probes it and refuses
 * anything else. The twins land in the SAME `dropped`/`refused` report arrays as
 * the matrix clones, so every caller that already prints or exit-codes on those
 * reports them without a line of new plumbing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, stated plainly:
 *  - It does not verify the TEMPLATE is current — a clone of a stale suite
 *    database is faithfully stale. `bun run test:db:setup` owns freshness.
 *  - The backend-termination step kills sessions on the TEMPLATE only (named,
 *    one by one, never the application database); a session opened between the
 *    terminate and the CREATE can still make the clone fail. That failure is
 *    loud (psql non-zero ⇒ throw), not silent.
 *  - `cp -c` (APFS clonefile) is this workstation's media copy; on a
 *    non-APFS volume it falls back to a plain copy and SAYS so.
 *  - An explicit `DEDALO_TEST_RAG_DATABASE` pins ONE vector database name for
 *    every process that inherits it, shards included; the name is then not
 *    derived from the shard and this sweep will NOT drop it (it says so, loudly,
 *    once per sweep). That configuration also means concurrent shards share one
 *    vector index — a collision this module can report but not fix.
