/**
 * THE CI IMAGE PIN — one digest for every place a tier runs.
 *
 * `ci/image.json` names the published build of ci/Dockerfile that the gates run in:
 * GitHub's hermetic/db/instance jobs (`container:`), GitLab's hermetic job (`image:`)
 * and `ci:local --docker` (which pulls it by digest). A verdict is then a property of
 * the commit, not of which runner or Mac judged it — the reason the image exists
 * (ci/README.md). Until 2026-09-26 only ci:local used the image, and a LOCAL build of
 * it at that: GitHub ran bare ubuntu-latest, GitLab bare oven/bun as root, so a local
 * green predicted neither.
 *
 * YAML cannot read this file, so the digest is also written literally into each
 * workflow; `test/unit/ci_workflow_tripwire.test.ts` holds every literal equal to it and
 * its fingerprint equal to this checkout's. `bun run ci:image:pin` (scripts/ci_image_pin.ts)
 * is the updater: it resolves the digest ci-image.yml published for the current
 * fingerprint and rewrites the lock and every literal in one step.
