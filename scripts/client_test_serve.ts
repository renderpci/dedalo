/**
 * CLIENT TEST SERVER (interactive) — the browser page on the SUITE database.
 *
 * `bun run test:client:server [--port <n>]`
 *
 * The headless runner (scripts/client_test_runner.ts) starts its own verified
 * server, runs everything and exits. This is the human counterpart: the SAME
 * suite database, served for browsing `/dedalo/test/client/index.html` by hand
 * — running one area with DevTools open, stepping a failing suite in the UI.
 * Without it the only page a developer has is their dev server's, which serves
 * the APPLICATION database — where the test-TLD fixtures do not exist, so
 * fixture-bound suites die in request.invalid_tipo and read like engine bugs.
 *
 * Same door as the runner, every step:
 *   repoint to the suite db → set its login credential → install the projects
 *   fixture → verify /health answers this checkout's marker fingerprint → serve.
 *   Ctrl-C sweeps the fixture and stops the server cleanly.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is reseed the canonical test3 playground: a
 * hand-browsed page is for inspecting state, and wiping it on every start would
 * defeat that. A suite that needs a pristine test3 is a `bun run test:client`
 * job — the reseed is the runner's, and only the runner's.
