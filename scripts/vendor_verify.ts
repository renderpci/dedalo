/**
 * VENDOR TREE INTEGRITY — recompute the digest of every committed third-party
 * tree under `vendor/` and compare it with `vendor/vendor_manifest.json`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A `vendor/` lib is third-party code we SERVE TO BROWSERS
 * (`src/core/client_libs/registry.ts`), and it escapes every integrity mechanism
 * the rest of the dependency tree enjoys: no registry, no lockfile line, no
 * `sha512-` integrity, no Dependabot, no `bun audit` row. What guards a
 * package-manager dependency is the lockfile hash; what guards a vendored one is
 * THIS file plus the manifest — nothing else in the repo hashes those bytes.
 *
 * The digest is deliberately a TREE digest, not a per-file list: it covers the
 * file set as well as the contents, so both an edited byte and an added or
 * deleted file move it. It is computed as
 *
 *     sha256( join( sorted( `${relpath}\0${sha256(bytes)}\n` ) ) )
 *
 * over every regular file under the lib root, relative paths POSIX-normalised,
 * so it is stable across platforms and independent of readdir order.
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS. From `test/unit/dependency_integrity_tripwire.test.ts` (every
 * `bun test`) and from `scripts/ci/audit.ts`, which the hermetic CI tier already
 * invokes — the vendor pass runs BEFORE the networked advisory audit precisely so
 * the offline skip in that script can never skip integrity too.
 *
 * WHERE IT DOES NOT RUN: at boot. Hashing ~11 MB of pdfjs on every server start
 * would buy nothing — a tampered checkout is caught by git and by CI, not by the
 * process that would already be running the tampered code.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT — distribution side. `test/unit/release_archive_tripwire.test.ts`
 * hashes NOTHING: it only refuses symlinks in the release archive. So this manifest
 * proves the CHECKOUT is intact; what protects an installation receiving an update
 * is the update's own archive-sha refusal (the manifest travels inside that archive
 * and is covered by its digest, not by an independent signature).
 *
 * THE ADVISORY AXIS (CLI-26, 2026-08-28). Integrity was only ever half the
 * question: a digest proves the bytes are the ones we pinned, never that the ones
 * we pinned are benign. `vendor/pdfjs` sat at 5.7.284 for 22 days inside
 * GHSA-hq66-cqwq-w95j (HIGH, arbitrary JS execution on opening a malicious PDF)
 * with every gate GREEN, because `bun audit` reads lockfiles and vendor/ has none.
 * So each manifest row now carries an `advisory` block: the coordinate an advisory
 * feed is keyed to (`npm` + `pdfjs-dist` + a plain semver), a review window, and a
 * LEDGER of the published advisories known to touch that version.
 * `checkVendorAdvisories()` below is the offline half — it hard-fails when the
 * declared version falls inside a ledgered range, and when `reviewed` is older than
 * the row's own window. `scripts/ci/audit.ts` adds the networked half: it asks the
 * GitHub advisory feed the same question and reds on anything the ledger does not
 * already carry, so the ledger cannot silently fall behind the world.
 * The two CALENDAR legs (lapsed window, expired acceptance) are separable
 * (`{ dated: false }`, 2026-09-26): the push gate runs the tree-only legs, the
 * nightly + lockfile/vendor path runs all of them, and `vendorWindowWarningsIn`
 * warns VENDOR_WINDOW_WARNING_DAYS (21) before either window closes.
 *
 * THE VERSION-BINDING AXIS (CLI-26 review, 2026-08-28). Both axes above ask their
 * question about the version the row DECLARES, and until this was added nothing
 * checked that the declared version was the version the bytes actually ARE. A row
 * reading `"version": "6.2.108"` over a 5.7.284 tree would have satisfied the digest
 * (it hashes whatever is there), the range check (it compares the declared string)
 * and the feed query (it asks about the declared string) — three green gates over an
 * unpatched tree, which is CLI-26 again with the label moved instead of the bytes.
 * So every row also carries `version_evidence`: clauses naming a file INSIDE its own
 * vendored tree and a literal that must appear in it, and each literal must itself
 * contain the declared version. `checkVendorVersionEvidence()` re-proves them, and
 * `verifyVendorTrees()` runs it, so the digest and the label are checked together —
 * and `--write` REFUSES to bless a tree whose bytes do not state the declared
 * version, which is the moment the mislabel would otherwise be committed. A tree
 * that states no version anywhere (json-view) says so in `unprovable_reason`; the
 * absence is stated, never implied.
 *
 * WHY AN ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A RUBBER STAMP. An advisory in range can be accepted,
 * but only with (a) a reason code from a CLOSED set, (b) an expiry date, and
 * (c) at least one `verify` clause this file re-proves against the tree on every
 * run — e.g. "vendor/ckeditor/build/ckeditor.js does not contain GeneralHtmlSupport",
 * which is the precondition both CKEditor advisories require. The moment somebody
 * rebuilds that bundle with the feature in it, the acceptance evaporates and the
 * gate is red. A date alone could never do that; that is the difference between
 * this and the nudge it replaces.
 *
 * THE ROOT AXIS (P2-5-residue / CLI-12 + PUB-12, 2026-09-04). A row used to MEAN
 * `vendor/<id>/` and nothing else, and `listVendorDirs()` was the census — so a
 * committed third-party tree anywhere else (five bundles under tools/** and
 * client/**, a 16 MB swagger-ui-dist under publication/) was outside every axis
 * above. Three of the five were registry packages and became package.json pins;
 * the trees that cannot be installed are rows here. swagger-ui must stay INSIDE the
 * v1 PHP publication API (a self-contained Apache+PHP folder that has no
 * node_modules and that `release_archive_tripwire` will not let us symlink into),
 * so a row may carry an explicit `root`: a tracked repo directory OUTSIDE vendor/
 * and node_modules. The complement law is unchanged for vendor/ — its directories
 * equal the rows WITHOUT a root — and `scripts/lib/third_party_census.ts` derives,
 * from the tree, every committed file that LOOKS third-party and requires it to lie
 * under some row's root. So a bundle dropped anywhere is red until it has a row.
 *
 * THE LICENCE AXIS (OPS-08, same date). Redistribution has a fourth question the
 * other three never asked: under what terms. Four of the trees shipped no licence
 * text at all. Every row now carries `licence: { spdx, file }` — an id from a
 * CLOSED set of licences compatible with this project's AGPL-3.0-only, and a file
 * INSIDE the row's own tree that must exist and must read as that licence
 * (`checkVendorLicencesIn`). A tree with no licence text cannot have a row.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/vendor_verify.ts            verify (exit 1 on any drift)
 *   bun run scripts/vendor_verify.ts --write    recompute digests/counts into the
 *                                               manifest, PRESERVING the curated
 *                                               fields (version, upstream,
 *                                               archive_sha256, reviewed, note).
 *                                               REFUSES when a row's declared version
 *                                               is not evidenced in its own bytes —
 *                                               blessing a digest over a mislabelled
 *                                               tree is the one thing this command
 *                                               must never do. Review the diff: a
 *                                               changed digest is a changed dependency.
