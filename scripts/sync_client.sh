# Phase 7 client seam — copy the vanilla-JS client from the READ-ONLY PHP tree
# (spec §2.5: copy, don't rewrite, the view layer).
#
# Layout: client/dedalo/ mirrors the PHP web root, so the TS server can serve
# the app at the SAME URL paths the PHP deployment uses (/dedalo/core/page/…).
# That matters because the client resolves everything relatively:
#   - assets:   ../../favicon.ico, ../../lib/threejs/…
#   - API:      ../api/v1/json/  (data_manager fallback when DEDALO_API_URL is
#                unset) → /dedalo/core/api/v1/json/ from /dedalo/core/page/
# so byte-identical copies at identical paths need ZERO call-layer edits for
# routing — the seam is only auth/environment (see docs/client_seam.md).
#
# What is copied:
#   - core/: every browser asset (js/css/less/html + images/fonts), git-tracked
#     (first-party client code, ~12MB);
#   - lib/: vendor libraries (threejs, ckeditor, pdfjs, …, ~118MB) — synced but
#     GITIGNORED; rerun this script after cloning.
#   - favicon.ico
#
# NOT synced: the repo-root tools/ tree is TS-OWNED (each tool is a self-contained
# package: js/ css/ img/ register.json + server/). It was seeded once from the PHP
# tools client and now diverges deliberately — port PHP tool JS changes by hand.
#
# Re-runnable: rsync only updates changes. Never writes to the PHP tree.

# TS-owned client divergences: syncing these back from the PHP tree would break
# the native behavior. Port PHP changes by hand (same pattern as tools/).
#  - diffusion_server_control (WC-005): reworked against the NATIVE diffusion
#    engine (job-queue actions replace the PHP daemon start/stop/restart).
#  - installer (WC-006): the TS-native install wizard; its diagnostics grid drops
#    the PHP/Apache-only checkers (php_version/gd/mbstring/…) the Bun server has
#    no PHP for. The PHP tree keeps its own PHP-era installer.
#  - error_reports (WC-018): TS-only maintenance widget browsing the error-report
#    intake (master installations only); it has no PHP twin to sync from.
#  - check_config render (WC-027): ONE file diverges — render_check_config.js gains
#    the TS-native "Database details" + "Runtime mode" readouts (db_info/runtime_mode,
#    payload fields the PHP server does not emit) and the eager-value folded-red fix.
#    The widget's OTHER files (check_config.js, css) stay byte-identical, so exclude
#    only the one renderer, not the whole dir. Port PHP renderer changes by hand.
#  - area_maintenance.less (WC-018): carries the error_reports widget @import
#    the PHP tree must not have; render_area_maintenance.js carries the
#    ENGINE_DISABLED_WIDGETS client-side gate (hides widgets THIS engine cannot
#    serve while the server catalog stays byte-identical to PHP).
#  - php_runtime widget js (2 files): TS renders the panel READ-ONLY (no
#    reset_opcache / in-place refresh — Bun has no PHP opcache); the PHP tree
#    keeps its mutating panel. Port upstream renderer changes by hand.

# tool_common relocation fixup (TS-owned): tool_common's client machinery lives
# in core (src/core/tools/client/), NOT the PHP tree's tools/tool_common/. The
# PHP core sources still import the old path, so rewrite it here after every sync
# (idempotent). Two consumers need two different targets:
#   - JS runtime imports are resolved by the browser via the server route
#     /dedalo/core/tools_common/ (src/server.ts → src/core/tools/client/), so
#     rewrite  tools/tool_common/  →  core/tools_common/.
#   - core/page/css/main.less is compiled on disk by lessc (there is NO runtime
#     LESS route), so its @import must reach the real file. Rewrite it to the
#     on-disk src/ path. Only main.less imports tool_common CSS, and always at the
#     ../../../ depth of core/page/css/, so the exact-prefix match is safe.
# Both passes are idempotent (the old pattern is gone after the first rewrite) and
# target disjoint file globs, so they never interfere.
