/**
 * PUBLISH THE MANUAL to dedalo.dev/docs/v7/.
 *
 * This script is THE GATE. Not a convenience wrapper around rsync — the only
 * route the manual has to production, with the checks standing in it rather
 * than beside it. Nothing external enforces anything: no CI job, no service,
 * no vendor. Run it on any machine with the deploy key and the result is the
 * same.
 *
 *   bun run docs:publish
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, in order. Each step must pass before the next runs:
 *
 *   1. CONTENT GATE  — docs_current_engine_tripwire (the manual documents the
 *                      current engine, links resolve, no gitignored paths) and
 *                      docs_versioning_tripwire (the version wiring agrees, and
 *                      no published page vanished without a redirect).
 *   2. BUILD GATE    — `mkdocs build --strict`, run HERE. It does not trust a
 *                      docs_site/ lying around from an earlier attempt; it
 *                      builds the tree it is about to ship. --strict promotes
 *                      MkDocs warnings to errors, so a dangling link fails the
 *                      publish instead of shipping a 404.
 *   3. UPLOAD        — rsync --delete, scoped INSIDE the version prefix, plus
 *                      versions.json and the routing .htaccess at the docs root.
 *                      Then, if DEDALO_DOCS_STAGE_DIR is set, mirror the same
 *                      tree into that local docs root so a preview copy cannot
 *                      fall behind the site.
 *   4. RECORD        — rewrite docs/published_paths.json with what was actually
 *                      served, which is what makes step 1's rename check real.
 *
 * HARD REFUSAL, NO OVERRIDE. A red gate exits non-zero having written nothing,
 * locally or remotely. There is deliberately no --force: the repo's posture
 * everywhere else (assertTestDatabase, the media-root marker) is to refuse
 * loudly rather than offer an escape hatch, because an escape hatch that exists
 * is one that gets used at the worst possible moment.
 *
 * WHY THE VERSION PREFIX MATTERS: --delete is scoped to DOCS_ROOT/v7/, so this
 * command cannot reach /docs/v6/ (frozen, and published from the v6 checkout)
 * nor any future /docs/v8/. A version's tree is only ever written by its own
 * repo. See deploy/docs/htaccess for the routing this assumes.
