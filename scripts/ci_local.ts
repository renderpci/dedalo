/**
 * RUN THE CI TIERS THE WAY THE RUNNER RUNS THEM — here, before pushing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/verify.ts` proves the code works ON YOUR MACHINE: with
 * ../private/.env loaded, your Postgres, your libc. The hosted tiers run with none of
 * that — `scripts/ci/db_tier.sh` composes its whole environment in-process precisely so
 * nothing is inherited, and there is no ../private/.env on a runner at all. Nothing
 * executed the tiers that way locally, so the RUNNER was the first place the code ever
 * met the runner's environment, and CI became the debugger: ~10 minutes and a pasted log
 * per iteration.
 *
 * MEASURED COST OF NOT HAVING THIS (2026-08-31): twelve defects in one day, every one
 * invisible to `verify` and guaranteed to be found by a runner and only by a runner —
 * an unset egress allowlist, an anti-vacuity probe that required the private file, the
 * parity census addressing a database nobody builds, eight config keys the tier never
 * composed, a BSD-only `gzcat`, an nginx gate that bound :80, a suite database that
 * inherited the host's collation. Four of those are caught by this script on a Mac; the
 * platform-bound ones need `--docker` (see below), which is the same script one layer
 * down.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not replace `verify` — that is the developer-environment
 * gate and stays. This is the OTHER environment, and both matter.
 *
 * TWO MODES.
 *
 *   HOST (default). The tier scripts run on this machine, with an empty scratch private
 *   dir. THE ONE THING IT BORROWS FROM ../private/.env is the Postgres CONNECTION (host,
 *   port, user, password) — never any application config. A runner is handed a database
 *   by its service container; you are handed one by your machine. That is a fact about
 *   where Postgres lives, not about how the engine is configured. Every DEDALO_* key the
 *   tiers need, they compose themselves — which is exactly the property under test. What
 *   host mode CANNOT reproduce is the platform: libc, GNU vs BSD userland, the media
 *   tools, the browser, the uid.
 *
 *   --docker. The tier scripts run INSIDE THE CI IMAGE (ci/Dockerfile — the image the
 *   workflows run in) through ci/compose.yml: the db/instance tiers against the SAME
 *   pgvector digest db.yml's service pins, reached by its name `postgres` exactly as a
 *   hosted container job reaches it; the hermetic tier with no database at all, as on its runner. Nothing
 *   is read from ../private — not even the connection. Every CI-vs-Mac difference that
 *   made the runner the debugger (2026-09: 25 red unit files there against 3 here, all of
 *   them missing ffmpeg/magick/poppler/mariadb) is gone by construction. See
 *   ci/compose.yml for what is copied from the workflows and why.
 *
 * WHAT --docker RUNS. By default the WORKING TREE: HEAD plus every tracked change and
 * every untracked, not-ignored file, made into ONE commit on top of HEAD inside the
 * container — the tree as it would be if you committed everything now. That shape is
 * load-bearing: the crap ledger compares against HEAD^ on a push, so the uncommitted
 * work must BE the tip, or the ledger would compare your edits against the commit before
 * the one you are standing on. `--ref <rev>` runs that commit EXACTLY instead (no
 * overlay) — the pre-push hook passes the sha being pushed, because a push sends
 * commits, not a working tree. The host repo is mounted read-only and never written.
 *
 * THE IMAGE. The LOCKED build — ci/image.json, the same digest GitHub and GitLab run
 * (scripts/lib/ci_image.ts) — pulled once and run by digest, so a local verdict is the
 * runner's verdict on the same bytes (an Apple-Silicon Mac gets the arm64 half of the
 * same multi-arch build). Only while ci/Dockerfile or .bun-version differ from the lock's
 * fingerprint — a definition not yet published — is `dedalo-ci:local` built from
 * ci/Dockerfile instead, and the run says so; `--build` forces that local build. Either
 * way the fingerprint label is verified before a tier starts.
 *
 * THE VERDICTS. Every tier's output is streamed through and parsed into stages from the
 * tier scripts' own `== <tier>: …` lines (their "the stages are independent" law makes
 * each stage print a header and, when red, a `RED in …` line). The summary names each
 * red stage with the command that reproduces or fixes it; `--summary <file>` also writes
 * it as JSON: {tiers:[{tier, verdict, exit_code, duration_s, stages:[{name, verdict,
 * fix_hint, failures}]}]}. Exit 0 green, 1 red, 2 could not run (no docker, no image,
 * no Postgres connection, bad arguments).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run ci:local              # every tier, on this machine, as CI runs them
 *   bun run ci:local --hermetic   # typecheck + lint + static tripwires + daemon packages
 *   bun run ci:local --db         # suite DB build + DB tripwires + unit tier + parity
 *   bun run ci:local --instance   # suite DB build + browser client suite + both update drills
 *   bun run ci:local --keep       # (host mode) leave the scratch private dir on disk
 *   bun run ci:local --docker [--hermetic|--db|--instance]   # the same, in the CI image
 *       [--ref <rev>]             # run that commit exactly, not the working tree
 *       [--build]                 # build ci/Dockerfile locally, not the locked image
 *       [--base <branch>]         # behave as a pull_request against <branch> (the base
 *                                 # is resolved from THIS repo's local branch of that name)
 *       [--audit-base <sha>]      # the push's `before`: what the remote had (the pre-push
 *                                 # hook passes its remote sha; default: host upstream)
 *   Any mode: [--summary <file.json>]
 *             [--skip-advisory]   # desk only: skip the db tier's ADVISORY unit stage (~5 min);
 *                                 # it cannot change the verdict, and the runner still runs it
 *   bun run ci:local --docker --record-unit-baseline [--allow-regression --reason "<why>"]
 *                                 # RECORD engineering/unit_baseline.json in the CI image
 *   bun run ci:local --docker --record-unit-baseline --new <file>[,<file>…]
 *                                 # record ONLY new files' floors (unit_baseline --record-new)
 *
 * RECORDING THE UNIT BASELINE (`--record-unit-baseline`, --docker only). The unit tier's
 * per-file floors and red set are a fact about the IMAGE (its toolchain, its uid, the
 * files a clone has and a desk has besides), so the baseline the runner checks against
 * is recorded where the runner runs: the db tier alone, in the image, with db_tier.sh's
 * unit stage switched to the WRITER (`DEDALO_CI_UNIT_RECORD_OUT`, its record mode — the
 * same suite build, MariaDB start, installs and DB-tripwire stage the check runs after,
 * not a second copy of them). The written JSON leaves the container through the one
 * WRITABLE mount, /ci-out, and is copied into this checkout; the source mounts stay
 * read-only. `--allow-regression` requires `--reason` (the commit message carries it; the
 * writer prints every regression it accepted). Host mode refuses the flag, and the
 * writer itself refuses outside the image (UNIT_TIER.recordOnlyInCiImage) — a Mac
 * recording is impossible from either door. `--new <files>` swaps the full writer for
 * `--record-new` (a new test file's floor, nothing else; refuses a red). The written file
 * is copied into the checkout only when the WHOLE db tier is green (recordCopyFault), and
 * `--ref` must name this checkout's HEAD on a clean tree (recordRefFault) — the recording
 * is written into this tree, so it must have measured this tree.
 *
 * The db and instance tiers each DROP AND REBUILD their own suite database. In host mode
 * that is `dedalo_ci_test` on your Postgres (distinct from the one `bun run
 * test:db:setup` builds, so yours is not disturbed); in --docker mode it is a fresh
 * pgvector container per tier, removed with its volume afterwards — as two CI jobs each
 * get a fresh service container.
 *
 * THE INSTANCE TIER ON macOS HOST MODE needs a short TMPDIR (`TMPDIR=/tmp/dd bun run
 * ci:local --instance`): the update drills bind unix sockets under it and macOS caps that
 * path at 104 bytes (AGENTS.md, test:update). --docker is Linux and needs nothing. The
 * tier is also the long one — a suite build plus 133 browser suites plus two drills.
