#
# THE HOST IMAGE UPDATER — OPT-IN, OFF BY DEFAULT (installer unification D4,
# 2026-10-09). It carries out, on the Docker HOST, an image update that an
# administrator REQUESTED in the code-update panel.
#
#   deploy/dedalo-image-updater.sh [run] [--stack-dir DIR]     one pass (the timer's job)
#   sudo deploy/dedalo-image-updater.sh install-units [--stack-dir DIR] [--user NAME]
#   sudo deploy/dedalo-image-updater.sh uninstall-units
#   deploy/dedalo-image-updater.sh print-units [--stack-dir DIR] [--user NAME]
#
# (--unit-dir DIR and --systemctl PATH re-point the two system locations the
# unit verbs touch; they exist for the gate, which never touches the real ones.)
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. A container installation updates by replacing its IMAGE, and
# only the host can do that. The engine is NEVER given docker.sock: a socket
# that lets the engine replace its own image would let anything that subverts
# the engine run any container, as root, on the host. So the panel can only
# RECORD a request (a file in the engine's private volume, image_update/), and
# this program — installed by the operator, running on the host — acts on it.
# Not installed means not running: the panel then shows the host command to
# type (deploy/dedalo-image-update.sh --version <tag>) instead of a button.
#
# ONE PASS (`run`, every minute from the timer):
#   1. one pass at a time (a mkdir lock in the stack directory); a held lock is
#      a pass already running — this one stops quietly;
#   2. .dedalo.env says where the image comes from, or nothing happens (logged);
#   3. the engine is running, or nothing happens (the request waits);
#   4. HEARTBEAT: tells the engine "a host updater is installed" — its interval,
#      the pinned source and version — which is what turns the panel's manual
#      command into a "Request this update" button. An image older than the
#      update channel has no CLI to receive it: logged, nothing else happens;
#   5. ORPHAN: a request claimed by a pass that never finished (host reboot,
#      timeout) is recorded as failed / interrupted;
#   6. CLAIM: the pending request, if any, becomes in flight;
#   7. HOST FLOORS, checked here whatever the engine said: a UUID request id, a
#      version tag (X.Y.Z or X.Y.Z-dev), and no downgrade against the PINNED
#      DEDALO_VERSION (the same version only for a -dev image). A request that
#      fails one is recorded as refused and nothing runs;
#   8. `./deploy/dedalo-image-update.sh --version <tag> --request-id <id>
#      --outcome-file <tmp>` — with its backup, health check and rollback. It is
#      NEVER passed --no-backup, --skip-version-check or --ref;
#   9. the outcome that script wrote is handed to the engine untouched (the CLI
#      validates it) through a one-off `compose run` of the pinned image — so it
#      is recorded whether the engine came back, was rolled back, or is down —
#      then through `exec`, and as a last resort into this program's log.
# Every pass that reaches a decision exits 0, so the timer keeps going; only an
# internal error (a usage error, a host floor this program cannot even address)
# exits non-zero, and systemd shows it as a failed run.
#
# THREAT MODEL. What a compromised engine (or a compromised superuser account)
# CAN do through this channel: ask for a newer tag — or the same -dev tag — of
# the repository the OPERATOR configured in .dedalo.env. That request still walks
# the engine's linear-upgrade rule, this program's own floors, a mandatory
# database backup and an automatic rollback; with DEDALO_IMAGE_VERIFY=cosign only
# an image signed by Dédalo's release workflow installs. What it CANNOT do:
# choose the repository, pull or build, a flag, a git ref, or anything else that
# is executed — those come from .dedalo.env and from this file. The host never
# reads the channel files itself (their host path varies with Docker Desktop,
# rootless docker or a remote DOCKER_HOST); it talks to the engine's CLI,
# scripts/ops/image_update_channel.ts, through `docker compose exec|run` and
# accepts back only a UUID and a version tag, re-checked here.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. install-units renders units that run as the OWNER of the stack
# directory (the account that ran install.sh), which must be able to use docker:
# a build-mode update runs git in the checkout, and git run as root refuses a
# checkout another account owns (and would leave root-owned files in it). The
# checkout must not be writable by anyone you would not trust with docker — this
# program executes deploy/dedalo-image-update.sh from it.
#
# HOSTS WITHOUT SYSTEMD (a NAS, for instance) run the same pass from the stack
# owner's crontab, once a minute:
#   * * * * * cd /path/to/master_dedalo && ./deploy/dedalo-image-updater.sh >>/path/to/dedalo-image-updater.log 2>&1
#
# Gate: test/unit/image_updater_host_native.test.ts (a stub docker runs the REAL
# channel CLI; a fake update script records its argv). Operator docs:
# docs/install/docker.md (The host updater); engineering/PRODUCTION.md §12.
#
# The whole program is functions and `main "$@"; exit` on ONE line: a build-mode
# update checks out another version of this checkout — this file included —
# while the pass is still running.
