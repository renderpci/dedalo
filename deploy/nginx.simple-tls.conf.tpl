# Dédalo v7 — SIMPLE nginx configuration WITH TLS (no media access control).
#
# TEMPLATE — not used directly. `install.sh` substitutes the three @@…@@ markers
# and writes deploy/nginx.simple.generated.conf, which docker-compose.simple.yml
# mounts. Edit this file to change every future generation; edit the generated
# one for a one-off (it is overwritten on the next install).
#
#   @@SERVER_NAME@@   the domain, or `_` for "any name" (local-CA / IP access)
#   @@SSL_CERT@@      full-chain certificate path, as seen INSIDE the container
#   @@SSL_KEY@@       private key path, as seen INSIDE the container
#
# Differs from deploy/nginx.conf (the full stack) in exactly one way: media is
# served OPENLY by the block below instead of through the engine-generated access
# rules. No per-record and no per-project checks — anyone who can reach this
# server reads every media file. TLS protects it in transit; it does not gate it.
#
# THE ROOT RULE: the media location carries no root/alias of its own, so the
# server `root` MUST satisfy
#     <root> + /dedalo/<DEDALO_MEDIA_DIR>/…  ==  MEDIA_PATH/…
# With MEDIA_PATH=/srv/dedalo/media and media dir 'media', that is `root /srv;`.
