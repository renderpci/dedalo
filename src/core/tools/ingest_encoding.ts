/**
 * INGEST DECODING — how an uploaded TEXT file becomes a string.
 *
 * The CSV doors read through here and the MARC21 parser makes the same decision
 * from its leader. `tools/tool_import_zotero` does NOT yet (an XML door has its
 * own declaration to honour) — it is the one entry in the shrink-only exemption
 * map of `test/unit/ingest_encoding_tripwire.test.ts`, which is the census that
 * keeps this list honest.
 *
 * DATA-09 (2026-08-26 audit): both CSV doors read their upload with
 * `await Bun.file(path).text()`, i.e. a UTF-8 decode with `fatal:false` (the
 * MARC21 door read BYTES and then decoded them just as leniently, never reading
 * the leader position that declares the record's encoding). Any
 * byte sequence that is not valid UTF-8 becomes U+FFFD — irreversibly, with no
 * error, no warning and no notice — and the replacement characters are written
 * into the records with a green file report. A CP1252 CSV (what Excel saves when
 * it opens a BOM-less export, which is what our own download half produced)
 * stored `Ripoll<FFFD>s` for `Ripollès`. Nothing downstream can undo that: the
 * original byte is gone.
 *
 * The frozen PHP did the opposite DELIBERATELY, and said so in a comment
 * (tool_common::read_csv_file_as_array): `mb_check_encoding($line,'UTF-8')` and,
 * on failure, `mb_convert_encoding($cell, 'UTF-8', mb_list_encodings())` for
 * every cell, latched for the rest of the file.
 *
 * THE RULE HERE: convert, or refuse — never substitute.
 *
 *  1. a UTF-8/UTF-16 BOM decides the encoding outright;
 *  2. otherwise a STRICT (`fatal:true`) UTF-8 decode is tried: valid → UTF-8;
 *  3. invalid → windows-1252, which is TOTAL (all 256 bytes map, verified) and is
 *     what a European spreadsheet actually writes. It is a CONVERSION, reported
 *     to the operator through `converted`, never a silent guess;
 *  4. a decode that yields NUL (a binary file, or UTF-16 with no BOM) is
 *     REFUSED, and so is one that yields U+FFFD — which, since the fallback is
 *     total, can only mean the FILE already carried the replacement character,
 *     i.e. it was damaged before it reached us. Each refusal says which it is.
 *
 * Why not PHP's `mb_list_encodings()` detection: it ranks ~80 candidate encodings
 * by heuristic and picks one; on a short cell it picks a different one than on a
 * long one, so the same byte could convert two ways in one file. A named,
 * measured fallback is the honest version of the same intent.
