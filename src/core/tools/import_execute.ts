/**
 * Shared import executor — turn mapped records (from any format: CSV, MARC21,
 * RDF/Zotero) into section records. For each mapped record: create a new record
 * (or reuse a matched section_id), conform each field's value(s) through the
 * import engine, and save via the standard component save path (TM-audited).
 *
 * Reused by tool_import_marc21 / tool_import_zotero / tool_import_rdf so the
 * write path is identical to the CSV import (which is scratch-twin verified).
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES THIS EXECUTOR OWES ITS CALLERS (P0-7, audit DATA-01/DATA-20),
 * all of which the CSV door already had and this one did not:
 *
 *   1. THE RUN IS ONE dd800 BULK PROCESS. Every TM row it writes carries that
 *      run's id, which is the ONLY thing that makes a wrong import revertable as
 *      one operation instead of row by row. The dd800 record is created BEFORE
 *      any data row is touched, ATOMICALLY (the row and its label are one
 *      transaction, so a failed label leaves no orphan), and a failure to create
 *      it REFUSES the run — an unattributable import is worse than no import. A
 *      run with NO mapped records mints nothing: there is no event to file.
 *   2. ONE TRANSACTION PER RECORD. A mid-record failure used to leave a
 *      half-written record committed; now the record's create and every one of
 *      its component saves commit or roll back together, and a failed record is
 *      reported instead of aborting (and discarding) the whole run.
 *      A CONSEQUENCE, deliberate and ledgered in the WC entry: an observer
 *      propagation failure now rolls the record back instead of being swallowed
 *      per record. Inside an ambient transaction a failed statement has already
 *      ABORTED it (observers.ts B6), so the swallow could only hide the cause
 *      and hand the record's remaining saves a poisoned transaction.
 *   4. EVERY WRITE IS ASKED OF THE WRITE DOOR (closure Step 3 req 10), as the
 *      importing principal: a matched record's field through
 *      `authorizeRecordAccess` (section floor, the dd128-aware pair — an import
 *      into dd128 must not set a user-manager's own dd1725 — and the write
 *      scope); a new record's section and every field's pair through
 *      `authorizeSectionTarget` before the create. The door the run's doors
 *      asked (the section, once) never named a record. A refused field is NOT
 *      written and is reported, like a refused value.
 *   3. THE WRITE LANGUAGE IS THE REQUEST'S. It comes from the request-language
 *      ALS (`currentDataLang()`), never from the static DEDALO_DATA_LANG: the
 *      write is lang-sliced, so the install default REPLACED the operator's
 *      actual working language and an empty cell CLEARED it. The ALS survives
 *      into the background job the import runs in (mediaJobs.submit exits only
 *      the transaction stores), so a backgrounded run keeps the session's lang.
 *   5. A DERIVED FIELD REFUSES THE RUN, before the dd800 mint and any write
 *      (assertNoDerivedField — the CSV door's posture).
