/**
 * CODE → RECORD ADDRESS, for the mapped-import doors (MARC21 today; the Zotero
 * door is the second caller the day its parser is re-ported — see the
 * per-door notes below).
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (audit DATA-08, closed 2026-08-30). An import file
 * carries a FOREIGN identifier: a library control number, a Zotero key, an
 * accession number. The MARC door used to hand that value to the shared import
 * executor AS THE section_id — so a control number of '42' wrote onto record 42
 * of the target section, whatever curated record already lived there, and when
 * no such row existed `saveComponentData`'s upsert branch minted one at that
 * meaningless id (save_component.ts :1064). Both were reported as success.
 *
 * The frozen engine never confused the two: `get_section_id_from_code`
 * (v7_php_frozen tools/tool_import_marc21/class.tool_import_marc21.php :1202,
 * and its twin in tool_import_zotero :1085) SEARCHED the identifier against the
 * section's own CODE component and let `resolve_target_section` create a record
 * when the search found none. That is the law this module restores, in the
 * engine's own search path rather than in a second hand-rolled query.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES A CALLER GETS:
 *
 *   1. THE SEARCH IS THE ENGINE'S. The lookup is an ordinary SQO run through
 *      `buildSearchSql` — the same assembler the list, the picker and every
 *      other search go through — so a code lookup can never drift from what the
 *      operator sees when they search that component by hand.
 *   2. THE MATCH IS EXACT, BY A SECOND READ. The `=` operator compares
 *      `f_unaccent(value) = f_unaccent(q)` and strips quotes from q
 *      (builder_string.ts :225-233), which is the right NARROWING but is not
 *      identity: 'Núñez-1' and 'Nunez-1' are one candidate set, and so are
 *      "O'Brien-1" and 'OBrien-1'. An identifier that resolves to a
 *      LOOK-ALIKE's record is the very defect this module closes, so every
 *      candidate's stored value is read back and compared as bytes; only an
 *      exact (trimmed) equal is an address.
 *   3. AMBIGUITY IS A REFUSAL, NOT A FIRST ROW. PHP took `limit 1` and wrote
 *      into whichever record the planner returned first. If two records already
 *      carry the identifier, no answer is honest — the caller is told, and
 *      writes nothing.
 *
 * SELECT-ONLY: this module resolves an address and never writes one.
 *
 * The heavy edges (the search assembler, the ontology resolver, the matrix
 * reader) are DYNAMIC imports, as they are in this directory's neighbours
 * (import_conform.ts, import_csv.ts): the tools layer sits above core, and the
 * import doors keep their static edge set small so a parser stays loadable when
 * an unrelated module below fails to parse.
