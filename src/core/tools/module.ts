/**
 * The ToolServerModule plugin contract — what a tool package's server/index.ts
 * exports so the loader can register it and the dispatcher can call its actions.
 *
 * This is the TS re-expression of the PHP tool class shape: `const API_ACTIONS`
 * (the remote surface + declarative permission gates), `const BACKGROUND_RUNNABLE`
 * (the second allowlist for async execution), and the framework hooks
 * `is_available()` / `on_register()` / `on_remove()`.
 *
 * DESIGN CHOICE (vs the PHP reflect-a-method model): there is NO reflection. A
 * tool method exists on the API only if it is a property of `apiActions`; the
 * handler is a typed function, so PHP's "method is public + static" and
 * "signature is (object $options)" gates are structural here, not runtime
 * checks. A tool is discovered by a deterministic, allowlisted directory scan
 * (see loader.ts) — never by request-supplied names.

 *                     its tipo-less, id-less special case and stays for the
 *                     pure per-section batch;

 *  - 'record'       → section level + the record (numeric options.section_id) must
 *                     be inside the caller's project scope;
 *  - 'record_tipo'  → BOTH: level `minLevel` on the (section_tipo, component tipo)

 *                     level 2 on one media component could still delete its files;
 *  - 'developer'    → caller must be a developer (no section target asserted);
 *  - null           → NOT gated here. A NAMED EXEMPTION: see ExemptToolActionSpec
 *                     below, which requires a `gatedInHandler` string saying what
