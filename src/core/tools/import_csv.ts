 *  - a field is ENCLOSED only when its first non-blank character is `"` (leading
 *    spaces/tabs before it are consumed, PHP's php_fgetcsv skips them);
 *  - inside an enclosure `""` is a literal `"`, and the delimiter, LF and CR are
 *    data — CR is kept verbatim, never folded into LF;
 *  - the first `"` that is not doubled CLOSES the enclosure, and whatever follows
 *    up to the delimiter/terminator is appended literally (`"q"tail` → `qtail`);
 *  - a `"` anywhere else is ordinary data (`12" disc`, `Alfonso X "el Sabio"`);
 *  - the row terminator is LF; a lone CR is DATA (the frozen reader read lines by
 *    LF, so an old-Mac file is one giant row — which the door then refuses);
 *  - an enclosure open at EOF absorbs the rest of the file (recorded, see above);
 *  - every cell is phpTrim'd, and a leading BOM is stripped from row 1's cells.
