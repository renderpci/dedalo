/**
 * PostgreSQL access for the Dédalo TS server.
 *
 * SQL CONFINEMENT — the TIERED rule (DEC-09; replaces the dead "SQL only in
 * core/db" absolute):
 *   T1 — CONNECTIONS: `new SQL(...)` (pool creation) is confined to core/db/,
 *        ai/rag/vector_store.ts (the separate RAG DB) and
 *        diffusion/targets/mariadb/ (the MariaDB publication target).
 *        Everything else uses the `sql` handle exported here.
 *   T2 — MATRIX DML: writes to matrix jsonb columns go through
 *        db/matrix_write.ts + db/json_codec.ts (the byte-compat chokepoint);
 *        raw `sql.unsafe` matrix writes are the audited exception list, and
 *        every `$n::jsonb` bind must be `$n::text::jsonb` (the Bun
 *        double-encode trap — found on 1.3.9, RE-VERIFIED STILL PRESENT on
 *        1.4.0, 2026-08-25) unless the file is on the object-binding
 *        allowlist — grep-gated by test/unit/ws_a_tripwires.test.ts.
 *   T3 — dd_ontology READS: converge on ontology/resolver.ts accessors
 *        (ratcheted; see WS-D).
 * Prepared-statement discipline (spec §7.7) is unchanged: values are ALWAYS
 * bound parameters; identifiers come from fixed allowlists (§7.6).
 *
 * Client: Bun's built-in SQL (Postgres). Queries use the tagged-template form
 * (sql`... ${value} ...`), which ALWAYS sends values as bound parameters —
 * string concatenation of user values is structurally impossible through this
 * API. Identifiers (table/column names) cannot be parameterized; they must
 * come from fixed allowlists validated at the §7.6 chokepoint BEFORE reaching
 * this layer.
 *
 * Connection: DB_HOST starting with '/' is a unix-socket DIRECTORY (Postgres
 * convention, e.g. '/tmp'); we derive the full socket path Bun expects.
 * Otherwise it is a TCP hostname. Verified against Bun 1.4.0 (2026-08-25).

 * exactly like a bare `SET`): a text holding a `;` is split into its statements
 * by the shared lexer (db/sql_lexer.ts — a `;` inside a literal splits nothing).
 *
 * SESSION STATE (the WC-055 class): a plain `SET`/`RESET`/`DISCARD` outlives the
 * caller's span on a pooled connection — the next request handed that
 * connection inherits it. So does one inside a `DO` body (PL/pgSQL executed
 * NOW, read RAW by the shared rule — `DO $$BEGIN SET … END$$`, or
 * `EXECUTE 'SET …'`), and a `set_config` that is not provably
 * transaction-local: only a literal `true` third argument is (a `false`, an
 * expression, a bound `$3` are refused — sql_lexer.setConfigCalls). `SET LOCAL`,
 * `SET TRANSACTION` and `SET CONSTRAINTS` die with the transaction and are
 * allowed.
 *
 * TRANSACTION CONTROL (`BEGIN`, `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `END`,
 * `ROLLBACK` — never `ROLLBACK TO`, `ABORT`, `PREPARE TRANSACTION`, and the
 * `… PREPARED` forms): on the transaction lane a `COMMIT` ends the unit
 * mid-way (every statement after it autocommits, and the recorder's ceiling,
 * savepoints and commit-only queue describe a transaction that no longer
 * exists); on the pooled lane a `BEGIN` hands the next caller a connection
 * inside someone else's transaction. `SAVEPOINT` / `RELEASE` / `ROLLBACK TO`
 * stay allowed (the recorder tracks them). A `DO` or procedure cannot COMMIT
 * inside a transaction block (Postgres refuses it), so the statement-leading
 * rule is complete for the transaction lane.
 *
 * The reserved lane is exempt: it is caller-owned (install/db/migrate.ts's
 * online run SETs and RESETs on it). Residual blind spot (ledgered): dynamic SQL
 * a FUNCTION (not a DO body) EXECUTEs is invisible to any lexer.
