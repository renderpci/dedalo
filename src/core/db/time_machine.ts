/**
 * Time Machine access — the matrix_time_machine audit table.
 *
 * TM is Dédalo's per-component change history, surfaced in the app as the
 * VIRTUAL section 'dd15'. Its table does NOT follow the standard matrix
 * contract (matrix.ts): rows are FLAT audit columns, one row per component
 * change (verified against the live dedalo_mib_v7 schema):
 *
 *   id               int PK    TM row id — this is what dd15 uses as section_id
 *   section_id       int       SOURCE record's section_id
 *   section_tipo     text      SOURCE record's section_tipo (e.g. 'oh1' — NEVER 'dd15'!)
 *   tipo             text      component tipo that changed
 *   lang             text      language of the changed data
 *   timestamp        text      when the change happened
 *   user_id          int       who changed it
 *   bulk_process_id  int|null  bulk operation identifier
 *   bulk_process_temp         (transient bulk bookkeeping)
 *   data             jsonb     the component data snapshot
 *   tm_role          smallint|null  NULL = an ordinary, VISIBLE history row;
 *                              otherwise a HIDDEN undo-log row (TM_ROLE below,
 *                              migration 0010_tm_role.sql)
 *
 * A dataframe MAIN's history is kept in TWO LANES (relations/main_lanes.ts,
 * WC-2026-09-27-bulk-revert-undo-log addendum "two lanes"): a LANGUAGE row
 * holds that language's value only; the lg-nolan row holds the main's lg-nolan
 * value followed by the FULL frames of every slot of the main. The state at row
 * R: each language's newest row <= R, and the frames of the newest FRAME-STATE
 * row <= R (readFrameStateRowAt — lg-nolan, or a PHP-era row carrying frames);
 * a slot a frame state is silent about was EMPTY then. No column, no epoch
 * marks anything; TS-era beta rows are unsupported history.
 *
 * CONTRACT POINTS the rewrite must keep (PHP: core/tm_record/class.tm_record.php,
 * core/search/class.search_tm.php):
 *
 * - section_tipo MISMATCH: the dd15 virtual section addresses TM rows by the
 *   TM row `id` (as its section_id), while the row's own section_tipo column
 *   holds the SOURCE section. Never filter TM by section_tipo='dd15' — the
 *   PHP search_tm build_main_where() is intentionally empty for this reason.
 * - APPEND-ONLY (header re-dated 2026-07-07, S2-45 — the old "this module
 *   exposes no write functions" claim was false): this module exports
 *   recordTimeMachine, the ONE writer the save/delete/restore pipelines
 *   append through, plus the three UNDO-LOG writers of a bulk run
 *   (recordBulkPair / recordBulkBirth / recordBulkCascadeDelete — this file
 *   stays the single matrix_time_machine writer, which is what the retention
 *   registry keys on). TM rows are never UPDATEd or DELETEd — the dd15 surface
 *   is a read-only view over an append-only table.
 * - VISIBILITY: a row with a non-NULL tm_role is undo-log bookkeeping, never
 *   history. Every history reader narrows with record_generation.ts
 *   `withTmHistory` (epoch AND tm_role IS NULL); only the bulk revert reads
 *   every role.
 * - Default ordering is timestamp DESC (search_tm default).
 * - SQO mode 'tm' routes to the TM search engine (Phase 3).

// revert itself — every door that mints a bulk_process_id) records, for every
// key it CHANGES, the exact bytes it replaced and the exact bytes it left, so
// that its revert is an exact inverse instead of an inference over history
// that may have been written with the time machine off.
//
// THE PAIR LAW (user decision D1): every save carrying a bulk id writes
//   - a hidden BEFORE row (tm_role = 1) — the region the write replaced, and
//   - its normal VISIBLE after-row (tm_role NULL, bulk_process_id set),
// whatever the caller's saveTm says; saveTm:false keeps its meaning only for
// writes OUTSIDE a bulk run. BEFORE is inserted first, so its id is lower, and
// both rows share one timestamp and the caller's transaction.
//
// TWO-LANE PAIRS (2026-09-28 addendum): a dataframe main's pairs are written
// under the MAIN's tipo only, per lane — one pair per language lane the write
// touched (its region), one lg-nolan pair (its lg-nolan region + every slot's
// full frames, relations/dataframe_slots.ts recordMainHistory) — for a main
// save AND for a slot save (which re-targets to the main it changed). A
// dataframe slot key never has a pair of its own.
//
// ABSENCE: `undefined` is "the key holds nothing" (concepts/lang_region.ts, the
// ONE absence law) and is stored as SQL NULL `data`. A stored JSON null is
// nothing too: recordBulkPair maps a `null` image to `undefined` (keyImage),
// because the write chokepoint restores `null` as a key REMOVAL — an image the
// revert cannot put back byte-exact would read as a post-run change on the next
