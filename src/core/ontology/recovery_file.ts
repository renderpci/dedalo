/**
 * dd_ontology recovery file (UPDATE_PROCESS Phase 2 — the
 * build_database_version widget pair; PHP installer_ontology_manager::
 * build_recovery_version_file / restore_dd_ontology_recovery_from_file).
 *
 * BUILD: materialize the whitelisted-TLD slice table (db/dd_ontology.ts
 * createRecoverySlice), pg_dump ONLY that table, gzip it to the
 * recovery slot (default <private>/db/dd_ontology_recovery.sql.gz — see
 * DEDALO_ONTOLOGY_RECOVERY_PATH and runtime_paths.ts), drop the slice.
 * RESTORE: gunzip (capped — the file is local but the caps are free) and
 * feed psql; this RECREATES the dd_ontology_recovery table in the live DB —
 * it deliberately does NOT overwrite dd_ontology (PHP parity: the merge/swap
 * is a manual operator step).
 * No shell pipelines: pg_dump stdout streams through in-process gzip.
 *
 * ONE AT A TIME, EACH ON ITS OWN FILES (cross-write:r2). Build and restore both
 * DROP/CREATE the one shared `dd_ontology_recovery` table and write next to the
 * one slot, so they run under ONE single-flight lock — a Postgres advisory
 * lock (db/dd_ontology.ts withRecoverySliceLock: per database, across every
 * engine process): a second build or restore is refused "already running",
 * never raced. Every temp file is THIS session's (core/files/temp_path.ts
 * tempPathFor — a fixed `.part` was truncated and renamed by whichever session
 * opened it last, and unlinked by the other's `finally`); a failure removes
 * only its own. The lock holder sweeps the slot's STALE temp siblings (a
 * crashed build's) — only those older than STALE_TEMP_AGE_MS: the lock is per
 * DATABASE, so another installation (or suite lane) sharing the slot's
 * directory may hold its own lock and be writing a FRESH sibling right now;
 * none can still be writing one older than twice its children's deadline.
 *
 * BOUNDED WHILE HOLDING THE LOCK (cross-write:r3). pg_dump and psql run under a
 * DEADLINE (RECOVERY_CHILD_DEADLINE_MS, a caller may pass a tighter one) and
 * pg_dump with `--lock-wait-timeout`: a child waiting on a table lock or a stalled
 * server is KILLED and the call fails — it never holds the single-flight lock
 * forever, refusing every later build and restore "already running".
