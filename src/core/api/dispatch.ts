/**
 * API dispatch — RQO → handler, behind the §7.1 allowlists and the auth/CSRF
 * gates (spec §7.1-7.3).
 *
 * Design (stronger than the PHP reflection fallback): handlers are EXPLICITLY
 * registered in the ACTION_REGISTRY map — there is no dynamic method lookup,
 * so an unregistered (api class, action) pair simply does not exist. The
 * registry is the single source of truth for what the API can do.
 *
 * Gate order per request (mirrors PHP dd_manager::manage_request):
 *   1. api class + action must be registered (allowlist);
 *   2. auth: session required unless the action is in NO_LOGIN_ACTIONS;
 *   3. CSRF: required for authenticated non-exempt actions (constant-time);
 *   4. idempotency: a stamped request executes ONCE, its twins replay its
 *      answer (CLI-01 / P0-10, WC-2026-08-28-idempotency-key — the gate block
 *      below carries the whole design, its residual window included);
 *   5. handler runs with an explicit RequestContext (no globals).
 *
 * WS-C S2-25: this file is REGISTRY ASSEMBLY + GATES + ENVELOPE only. The
 * per-class handler bodies live in api/handlers/<class>.ts (statically
 * imported below); the read sub-action routing lives in the section facade
 * (src/core/section/read_facade.ts).
 *
 * ENVELOPE v2 (engineering/ERRORS_SPEC.md §4 — the converter chokepoint):
 * every gate REFUSES BY THROWING a DedaloError; a handler succeeds by
 * returning `ok(data, …)` and fails by throwing. The ONE catch below turns
 * any throw into `{status, body}` via toErrorEnvelope (registry status,
 * ok:false ⇒ non-2xx, Retry-After threaded on the ApiResult) and reports it
 * through logError. A handler body that is NOT an envelope (no `ok` key —
 * the PHP `{result,msg,errors}` fossil) is a BUG, refused loudly as
 * `internal.unexpected` naming the action (the P1-era legacy_body_adapter
 * that used to translate it is DELETED; error_taxonomy_tripwire guards).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// GATE 4 — IDEMPOTENCY (CLI-01 / P0-10, WC-2026-08-28-idempotency-key)
//
// THE DEFECT. The browser transport re-sends a POST when its OWN AbortController
// fires at the 5 s per-attempt deadline. That abort is client-side only: this
// process has no `request.signal` handling anywhere, so the aborted attempt's
// handler runs to completion and COMMITS. The resend was therefore not a
// replacement but a SECOND operation — one click on "New record" on a throttled
// link minted up to five blank records in the catalogue, one click on
// "Duplicate" up to five clones of a heritage record.
//
// THE FIX, in one sentence: a stamped request executes ONCE; its twins are
// served the answer the first one gave, or told that the outcome is unknown.
//
//   - WHERE the record lives: an in-process ledger, bounded four ways (age,
//     per-principal entries/bytes, and a process-wide entry/byte backstop). NOT a
//     table — and that is a real limitation, stated in full below rather than
//     glossed. The durable version writes the key row inside the WRITE's own
//     transaction, which is the only design with no residual window at all; it
//     cannot be built at this chokepoint, because the transaction is opened
//     downstream inside the handler — when it is opened at all.
//   - WHEN it is written: the reservation is made BEFORE the handler runs, and
//     completed with the answer after. Recording only AFTER the commit would
//     leave open exactly the window the defect already exploits (a retry landing
//     between commit and record).
//   - CONCURRENCY, which is what a retry storm actually produces: the reservation
//     is inserted SYNCHRONOUSLY between the `get` and the first `await`, so a
//     twin arriving while the leader is still running cannot also become a
//     leader. It awaits the leader's own promise and answers with the leader's
//     answer — never a half-built one, never a second execution.
//   - WHAT A REPLAY RETURNS: the ORIGINAL response, verbatim (plus an
//     `idempotent_replay` marker and this request's own fresh csrf_token). When
//     the answer was too large to store, the replay is REFUSED with
//     `idempotency.replay_unavailable` — re-executing a non-idempotent write is
//     the defect, so a typed conflict is the correct second best.
//
// THE AMBIGUOUS-OUTCOME RULE, which is the whole reason this gate is not a
// cache. A HANDLER THAT THREW MAY ALREADY HAVE COMMITTED. That is not a
// hypothetical here, it is the measured shape of the two doors the finding
// names:
//
//   - `section/record/duplicate_record.ts` opens NO transaction at all. The
//     clone COMMITS at insertMatrixRecordWithCounter, and media copies, the two
//     Time Machine rows per component, the observer cascade and fireSaveEvent
//     all run after it, uncovered. A throw in any of them follows a committed
//     duplicate.
//   - `dd_core_api:create` commits its row and THEN awaits fireSaveEvent and
//     logActivity outside any transaction.
//
// So "it threw, therefore nothing happened" is FALSE, and freeing the key on a
// throw would hand the next retry a second clone of a heritage record — CLI-01
// itself, reached through the error path. The rule is therefore:
//
//     ON AN AMBIGUOUS OUTCOME, DO NOT RE-EXECUTE.
//
// A leader that throws KEEPS its reservation, marked `ambiguous` with the
// original failure's code and request_id. The leader itself still receives its
// own real error — that is the truth about its own attempt. Every later request
// under the same key is refused with `idempotency.outcome_unknown` (409), which
// names the action, the original request_id and the original error code, and
// tells the operator to reload before acting. A duplicate heritage record
// created silently is worse than an error a curator can act on.
//
// THIS LOCKS OUT NOTHING LAWFUL. The key names ONE LOGICAL OPERATION and is
// minted per call by the transport, so the operator's own deliberate re-click
// mints a NEW key and executes normally. What is refused is only the AUTOMATIC
// resend of the very attempt whose outcome nobody knows — and the reservation
// expires with the TTL below in any case.
//
// A TWIN NEVER WAITS FOREVER. `await entry.pending` on a leader stuck on a
// Postgres row lock would pin one socket per twin for as long as the lock holds,
// and this engine now takes owner row locks from read to COMMIT on the delete
// path. The wait is bounded by IDEMPOTENCY_TWIN_WAIT_MS; past it the twin is
// refused with `idempotency.in_progress` (409) — again NOT re-executed, because
// a leader that is still running is the most ambiguous outcome there is. The
// leader keeps running and keeps the reservation, so the next retry gets either
// its answer or its `outcome_unknown`.
//
// THE RESIDUAL WINDOW, stated because it exists: (a) a process restart between
// the commit and the retry empties the ledger, so that retry re-executes;
// (b) so does eviction — see the eviction note below; (c) a multi-process
// deployment would hold one ledger per process (this engine is single-process
// today — one Bun process on one socket). None of the three is the measured
// defect: the retry storm is one client, on one process, within seconds, and it
// is closed completely.
//
// EVICTION, stated CORRECTLY (this claim was wrong in the first draft and is
// worth the extra sentence). The bounds are per-principal FIRST — one operator's
// writes can only ever evict that same operator's entries — and the process-wide
// entry/byte caps are a memory backstop behind them. The backstop is NOT
// per-principal: with IDEMPOTENCY_MAX_ENTRIES / IDEMPOTENCY_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES
// divided by the per-principal caps below, it takes tens of simultaneously
// active operators to reach it at all, and when it is reached the eviction is
// oldest-first across principals. So the honest statement is: an operator cannot
// evict another operator's entries by their OWN volume; a crowd of operators
// together can, and that is the accepted residual (b) above.
//
// WHAT IS NOT LEDGERED, deliberately and enumerated: an UNAUTHENTICATED request
// (there is no principal to scope a bound to, so an anonymous caller would be
// bookkeeping the process-wide backstop for free — the pre-auth actions are
// login/change_lang/the two password-reset doors, none of which touches the
// catalogue), and every action classified `idempotent` below (reads are the
// volume and the large answers; retrying one is lawful and must stay lawful —
// CLI-01 is about stopping DUPLICATE EXECUTION, not retrying).
//
// NOT REACHED BY THIS GATE, enumerated so it is not mistaken for coverage: the
// MULTIPART upload branch in `src/server.ts` answers before dispatchRqo and
// therefore never passes here — and it is the receiver of the one client
// transport that already retries by itself (upload_transport.js, max_retry 3 per
// chunk). What bounds it there is its own per-transfer identity: `transfer_id`
// is minted ONCE per transfer and every retried chunk carries the same one, so a
// resent chunk lands in the same staging artifact instead of a second one. The
// step that turns staged chunks into a record — `join_chunked_files_uploaded` —
// comes back through the JSON door and IS gated here.

 * surface is pre-auth by design (a fresh instance has no session), but ONLY
 * on a genuinely fresh / mid-wizard box (installSurfaceReachable:
 * INSTALL_MODE || installInProgress, never once sealed) and ONLY from an
 * allowed address. A CONFIGURED or PHP-migrated instance is NOT reachable —
 * keying on the bare seal check alone exposed the unauthenticated installer on
 * every coexistence deploy (no install_status ⇒ not "sealed"). Not-reachable
 * answers `install.not_reachable` (404, GONE), the same shape a sealed
 * instance gives.
 *
 * 1c — error-report intake window (WC-017). Disabled ⇒ the EXACT Gate-1
 * unregistered-action refusal (unknownAction), so a probe cannot learn the
 * endpoint exists on this host; the optional IP allowlist mirrors the
 * install gate. Throttle/token/schema live in the handler.

/**
 * Gates 2 + 2b + 3 — authentication, maintenance, CSRF.
 *
 * 2 — the exemption is keyed on the (class, action) pair. The install surface
 * is additionally pre-auth WHILE UNSEALED (runPreAuthGates); individual
 * record-writing install steps re-check the session in the handler. WC-051:
 * `auth.not_logged` is the code the client's re-login recovery dispatches on
 * — this is the path an EXPIRED session takes, so it is the one that must
 * reach render_relogin() rather than dying as a thrown fetch error.
 *
 * 2b — maintenance mode (AUTH-05). PHP verify_login() re-checks maintenance
 * on EVERY request and demotes any non-root session to unauthenticated while
 * the flag is set. The login gate (auth.ts login()) blocks only NEW logins, so
 * a session minted BEFORE maintenance was enabled stayed free to keep writing
 * into the matrix tables during a data-version migration under maintenance —
 * the exact corruption window this closes. Re-checked per request; refuses
 * every non-superuser session with `auth.maintenance` (401 — the
 * unauthenticated status, so the client's relogin policy keys on BOTH codes)
 * so only root — who enables and lifts maintenance — traverses.
 * `session.userId` is the user's section_id (-1 === SUPERUSER_ID for root),
 * the same identity the login gate keys on; getServerState() reads
 * ts_state.json uncached, so the flag is live the instant root sets it.
 *
 * 3 — CSRF for authenticated, non-exempt actions. `auth.csrf_failed` (403) is
 * the code the client's transparent single retry keys on (SEC-008,
 * data_manager); the envelope MUST carry the session's current token
 * (`csrf_token`, appended by executeRqo to every response) so that retry can
 * succeed — without the fresh token the client would loop on the stale one.
 * `action` rides as an extension key for the same reason it always did.
