/**
 * ACTIVITY — the ONE read model that answers "what work of mine is running?".
 *
 * There are TWO job systems in this engine, and they are legitimately different
 * rather than accidental duplicates:
 *
 *  - `mediaJobs` (core/media/jobs.ts) — the general IN-PROCESS registry. AV
 *    transcodes, every tool background action routed through
 *    core/tools/background.ts (imports, indexation), the backup widget, the
 *    unit-test runner. Ephemeral: a restart loses them, and the boot sweep flips
 *    the orphans to 'interrupted'.
 *  - the DIFFUSION queue (src/diffusion/jobs/) — a durable Postgres queue whose
 *    jobs run in SEPARATE spawned runner processes with heartbeats and a
 *    re-queueing sweeper. Publication lives here.
 *
 * A tray that read only the first would show a video transcode and SILENTLY OMIT
 * a running publication — the longest process in the system. Omission reads as
 * "nothing is happening", which is the exact bug this whole path exists to kill,
 * so the aggregation is the point of this module, not a convenience.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE MUST NOT DO: unify the two wires. Diffusion's `ProgressData`
 * is pinned byte-for-byte against the old engine, with golden fixtures carrying
 * an independent copy of its constants (test/parity/fixtures/diffusion/pinned.ts)
 * and 16384-char SSE padding for proxy flushing; `JobStatusFrame` is the media
 * poll shape. Both stay exactly as they are. This is a READ-SIDE PROJECTION: it
 * writes nothing, owns no state, and every row names the stream its own system
 * already serves so the client subscribes THERE for live updates.
 *
 * HOW THE DIFFUSION HALF GETS HERE — the INVERSION, not an import. `src/core/**`
 * may not import `src/diffusion` (the boundary tripwire allows three named
 * seams, and an aggregator is not one of them). So this module owns a PROVIDER
 * REGISTRY and startServer's diffusion boot chain registers into it, exactly as
 * `core/api/counters.ts` does for the diffusion gauge. Core states the shape it
 * wants; the subsystem supplies it. An install with diffusion disabled simply
 * has no provider registered and the tray shows media work only — which is the
 * truth on that install, not a degradation.
