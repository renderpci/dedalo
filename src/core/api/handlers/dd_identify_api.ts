/**
 * dd_identify_api — the object-identification engine over the normal API.
 *
 * FOUR actions:
 *
 *   find_matches       { section_tipo, section_id, limit? }
 *     → { seed:{…,thumb_url}, profile:{id,label}, results:[{…,thumb_url}],
 *         more_available, blind_criteria, restricted_criteria }
 *     "What else is like THIS RECORD?" — structural agreement over a profile.
 *
 *   identify_by_image  { image, section_tipo?, limit? }
 *     → { model, scope, results:[{…, similarity, types:[…]}], warnings }
 *     "What IS this?" for material with NO record yet: a photograph the curator
 *     just took, matched against the image index. See its own header below.
 *
 *   get_proposals      { section_tipo, section_id, source?, limit?, model_id? }
 *     → { seed, profile, sources:[…], proposals:[{…, provenance, target}] }
 *     "What SHOULD this record say?" — the read half of "AI proposes, human
 *     confirms", over BOTH proposal sources. The vision source is OPT-IN (it
 *     costs money and may egress); see its own header below.
 *
 *   resolve_type_link  { section_tipo, records?, check_type_id? }
 *     → { type_section:{…}, links:[…], existing_types:[…], type_record:{…}|null }
 *     "Where would a cluster be PROMOTED to?" — the component that links an
 *     object to its canonical Type (derived from the profile, never guessed),
 *     what this caller may write, and the Types the given members already carry.
 *     A READ: the attach itself is the ordinary component save, from the client.
 *
 * Registered in the static ACTION_REGISTRY (core/api/dispatch.ts), so the
 * class+action allowlist admits exactly this and nothing else; the dispatcher
 * has already required a session and verified CSRF before a handler here runs.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS HANDLER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * IDENTITY. `findMatches` takes a REQUIRED principal because an absent one means
 * "internal search, skip the projects filter" to the SQL assembler — see its
 * MatchInput.principal note. This handler passes the request's seeded principal
 * (`requirePrincipal`) and nothing else: it is the ACL gate, not a parameter.
 *
 * DECLINING, not throwing. Three ordinary situations are answers, not errors —
 * the section has no profile, its profile is malformed, the caller may not read
 * the record — and each returns the standard `{result:false, msg, errors:[code]}`
 * envelope so the client can say something useful instead of surfacing a 500.
 * The engine's own contract is preserved: a malformed profile is still LOUD (it
 * reaches the curator as `invalid_profile` + the parser's exact message, never as
 * a quietly reduced result set), and an unreadable seed is refused rather than
 * answered with "no matches", which would be a worse answer than a refusal.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS. The section read grant is checked BEFORE the profile is loaded,
 * so a caller with no access to a section cannot use the decline codes to learn
 * whether it has an identification descriptor.
 *
 * EXPLANATIONS ARE NOT OPTIONAL. Every result carries its per-criterion
 * `outcomes`, and the response carries `blind_criteria` (criteria the SEED has no
 * value for, so they discriminated nothing) and `restricted_criteria` (criteria
 * THIS CALLER may not read, so the score is computed without them and is
 * partial). A bare score is either ignored or trusted far past what it means —
 * and a partial one that does not say it is partial is worse than a bare one.
 *
 * PICTURES ARE RESOLVED HERE, not by the client. Identification is a visual task,
 * and only the PROFILE knows which media component stands for the object (the
 * candidate's section is arbitrary). `thumb_url` is therefore built server-side
 * through the media subsystem's own path grammar, and is null unless the file
 * exists — a URL to an ungenerated derivative is a broken image in every row.
 *
 * WIRE SHAPE: snake_case, like every other API payload in this engine
 * (`section_tipo`/`section_id`), converted at this boundary from the subsystem's
 * TS-side camelCase.

 *  - `required` — the criterion is the profile's GATE, so its declared `weight`
 *    is deliberately out of the ratio (IDENTIFY_SPEC §5). Without the marker the
 *    weight alone is unreadable: it reports a contribution the criterion did not

/**
 * IDENTIFY A PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMETHING THAT HAS NO RECORD YET.
 *
 * An object arrives at the museum. Before anything is catalogued, the curator
 * wants the nearest already-catalogued objects and what they are: "this looks
 * like these five coins, which are all Type X". So the input is an IMAGE, not a
 * locator — `find_matches` above answers the other question ("what else is like
 * this RECORD?") and needs a record to exist first.
 *
 * ── THIS PATH IS READ-ONLY, AND LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND ────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here writes: no record is created, no vector row is stored, no file is
 * staged. The uploaded bytes live in memory for the length of one request, are
 * handed to the encoder, and are dropped — there is deliberately no disk step to
 * clean up (and therefore no temp file to leak when a request fails halfway).
 * The image is a QUERY, and a query is not a document: indexing it would put an
 * unaccessioned object into the corpus that answers everybody else's searches.
 *
 * ── THE INPUT IS BOUNDED BEFORE IT IS TRUSTED ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Base64 is 33% larger than what it encodes, so the length of the STRING is
 * checked before it is decoded — decoding first would already have paid the
 * memory. Then the decoded bytes are sniffed by MAGIC BYTES
 * (`media/engine/mime.ts`, the same sniffer the upload path uses) and refused
 * unless they really are one of the raster formats an image encoder can read.
 * A declared MIME/data: prefix is never trusted, exactly as in the upload path.
 *
 * ── IT DECLINES, IT NEVER 500s ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Media indexing off, RAG off, an egress policy that forbids the configured
 * provider, an unusable image, an encoder that failed — all ordinary answers, all
 * `{result:false, errors:[code]}` at HTTP 200. In particular `buildMultimodalProvider`
 * THROWS a legible operator message when the egress policy would ship the
 * photograph off the host; that message travels to the curator as a decline
 * rather than dying in the dispatcher's last-resort catch.
 *
 * EMPTY INDEX IS NOT "NO MATCHES". `empty_index` says nothing has been indexed to
 * compare against; an `ok` answer with zero results says the corpus WAS searched
 * and nothing came close. Collapsing the two would let a curator read "we have
 * nothing like this object" off an installation that has simply never run the
 * image indexer.
 *
 * ── ACCESS CONTROL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A vector hit is never an oracle (`ai/rag/object_retrieval.ts`). Every hit goes
 * through `aclFilterCandidates` — the RAG subsystem's single chokepoint (schema
 * ACL + per-record projects filter) — before any of it is read or returned, and a
 * requested scope is narrowed to the sections this principal may open. Reading a
 * record's LABEL and its Type link is a second read of a second component, so
 * each is re-gated per (section, component) and each Type record passes the
 * record-scope gate before its label is quoted. Denials are silent: a "3 hidden"
 * count is an existence oracle.

/* ══════════ get_proposals — the read half of "AI proposes, human confirms" ══════════ */

/**
 * PROPOSE VALUES FOR THE CRITERIA A RECORD LEAVES EMPTY.
 *
 * Two engines answer this question and they answer it in the same SHAPE while
 * making fundamentally different CLAIMS:
 *
 *   - `ai/identify/propose.ts` — a similarity-weighted vote over the neighbours
 *     that are already tagged. "Seven similar coins record this." No model, no
 *     egress, and every proposal cites the records it came from.
 *   - `ai/identify/vision.ts` — a vision model shown the record's photograph and
 *     constrained to the profile's own controlled vocabulary. "A model looking
 *     at the picture suggested this, because …".
 *
 * A curator must not confirm those two on the same evidence, so the wire never
 * lets them blur: every proposal carries `source` and a `provenance` object that
 * is a DIFFERENT shape per source (citing neighbours vs. naming the model, its
 * egress class, its stated reason and the photograph it read). The UI is then
 * able to distinguish them because the data does — not because it remembered to.
 *
 * ── THE VISION SOURCE IS OPT-IN, ALWAYS ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It calls a paid model and, depending on the deployment, sends the record's
 * photograph off the host. That is never a side effect of opening a panel. The
 * default `source` is the neighbour vote ALONE; the vision source runs only when
 * the request names it (`source: 'vision'`, or `'all'` for both). The answer
 * SAYS SO — an unrequested source rides along in `sources` with
 * `declined:{reason:'not_requested'}`, so "no vision proposals" can never be
 * misread as "the model found nothing".
 *
 * ── DECLINING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Whole-request declines are find_matches's, for the same reasons and in the
 * same order (section grant BEFORE the profile, so the codes are not an oracle):
 * `missing_seed`, `forbidden`, `no_profile`, `invalid_profile`, plus
 * `invalid_source` for a source name nobody defined — never silently narrowed to
 * the default, which would answer a different question than the one asked.
 *
 * A SOURCE being unavailable is NOT a request failure. Each source reports its
 * own outcome in `sources[]`: the vision module's own `declined` reasons (no
 * model configured, egress forbidden, no photograph, no vocabulary…), or
 * `source_failed` with the error's message when a source threw. The other
 * source's proposals still travel.
 *
 * ── ACCEPTANCE IS A CLIENT ACTION, AND THIS SAYS WHERE IT MAY LAND ───────────
 *
 * Nothing here writes (both engines are structurally write-free, gated by
 * `identify_propose.test.ts`). Confirming a proposal is the ordinary component
 * save the record form issues. But a criterion is an SQO PATH, and a MULTI-HOP
 * path's value does not live on this record at all — it lives on the linked
 * record the first hop reaches. Writing it to the seed would put a curator's
 * confirmation in the wrong place, silently.
 *
 * So every proposal carries a `target`: whether it is writable HERE, the exact
 * (section_tipo, component_tipo, component_model) it would be written to, and
 * when it is not writable, WHY — `multi_hop` (with the linked records the
 * curator can open instead, ACL-gated), `forbidden_component` (read-only for
 * this caller: the write grant is checked here, not guessed by the client),
 * `unsupported_value_kind` (a date range is not one component-dialect value this
 * flow can honestly compose), `foreign_section`. The client renders a
 * non-writable proposal read-only with that explanation; it never guesses.

/* ═══════ resolve_type_link — what a cluster may be PROMOTED into ═══════ */

/**
 * WHERE A CLUSTER BECOMES A TYPE — the read that makes promotion possible, and
 * the only server work promotion needs.
 *
 * A curator looking at a cluster ("these thirty coins are the same thing") wants
 * to stop the grouping being implicit: mint a canonical **Type** record, or point
 * at the one that already exists, and link every member to it. That link is an
 * ORDINARY `component_portal` value, so the write is the standard `change_value`
 * component save issued per member from the client — the precedent
 * `tools/tool_cataloging/js/tool_cataloging.js` set, and the reason `src/ai/identify/*.ts`
 * stays inside the no-write static scan (IDENTIFY_SPEC §8.2). There is deliberately
 * NO confirm/attach endpoint here: a second write path into portals would have to
 * re-implement the TM audit, the observers and the permission re-check the first
 * one already does, and would drift from it the first time either changed.
 *
 * What the client CANNOT work out for itself is three facts, and this action is
 * exactly those three:
 *
 *  1. **Is promotion meaningful at all?** `typeSectionTipo` is null for a corpus
 *     with no published typology (a photo archive clusters happily and has
 *     nothing to promote INTO). That is a normal, stated fact about the
 *     collection, so it is a DECLINE with its own code — the panel says so in
 *     words and offers no button, rather than showing one that cannot work.
 *  2. **Which component holds the link?** Derived from the profile by
 *     {@link typeLinkCandidates}, never guessed. A section usually has several
 *     relation components aimed at the Type section; writing a curator's
 *     confirmation into the wrong one is invisible and permanent. When no
 *     criterion reveals it, this REFUSES (`no_link_component`) instead of
 *     picking the plausible portal.
 *  3. **What may this caller actually do?** The write grant on the link
 *     component, the write grant on the Type section (can a new Type be minted
 *     at all), and the Type section's own label component — all resolved
 *     server-side, because a client-side guess about permissions is a guess.
 *
 * It additionally SURVEYS the members it is given (`records`): the Types they
 * already link to, with how many members each. That is what makes "attach to an
 * existing Type" the one-click common case it should be — the type is usually
 * already catalogued and usually already on some of the cluster's members —
 * without inventing a record picker. Every value read is gated twice (the
 * component grant on the member, then the record scope gate on the Type before
 * its label is quoted), exactly as `identify_by_image` gates its `types`.
 *
 * And it CHECKS a hand-typed Type id (`check_type_id` → `type_record`,
 * {@link checkTypeRecord}): the one place the flow takes a locator from a
 * keyboard is the one place a typo becomes thirty locators on a record that does
 * not exist, and no downstream gate catches that for a portal.
 *
 * IT WRITES NOTHING.
