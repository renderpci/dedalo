/**
 * Activity log rows (PHP logger::$obj['activity'] → matrix_activity, section
 * dd542): every state-changing API action appends an audit row —
 *
 *   relation.dd543 = the acting user's locator (dd128, no item id)
 *   relation.dd545 = the WHAT code locator (dd42 — see WHAT_CODES below)
 *   string.dd544   = the client host, string.dd546 = the WHERE tipo
 *   date.dd547     = the virtual-calendar instant (no id/lang)
 *   misc.dd551     = [{lang:'lg-nolan', value: <action payload>}]
 *
 * (!) PHP also writes relation.dd550 = the actor's PROJECTS locators
 * (filter::get_user_projects, re-stamped to from_component_tipo dd550). We do
 * NOT — see the WIRE_CONTRACT entry. Every TS-written row lacks that dimension.
 *
 * The section_id comes from the matrix_activity_section_id_seq POSTGRES
 * SEQUENCE (PHP inserts without section_id — the dd542 matrix_counter lags
 * and is NOT the allocator here). Failures are logged and swallowed (an
 * audit write must never fail the user action — PHP posture).

 * PHP WHAT message → dd42 code (logger_backend_activity::$what). Keys are the

 *
 * The map mirrors dd42 in FULL (all 16 codes) because the READ side already
 * does: area_maintenance/user_stats.ts WHAT_MAP resolves 1-16 → dd696…dd1081
 * for the user_activity widget. Four codes have no emitter — here or in PHP:
 *
 *   SEARCH 8, UPLOAD 9, STATS 15  — defined in PHP's $what but never passed to
 *       log_message() anywhere in v6 or the frozen v7. Never implemented.
 *   DOWNLOAD 10 — a v5-era event ('download file by tool av / image / pdf')
 *       LOST IN THE v6 MIGRATION. matrix_activity still holds dd1080 rows from
 *       2019-2020 and none after, and the v5→v6 upgrade map
 *       (class.activity_v5_to_v6.php) still translates it — so the code must
 *       stay readable even while nothing writes it.
 *
 * They are mapped, not omitted: an emitter added later needs only its call
 * site, and the map stays a faithful mirror of the ontology section. None is
 * ruled out permanently — reinstating DOWNLOAD in particular is an open
 * question, not a closed one.
