 * 304s, per-type Cache-Control, and negotiated gzip with a process-lifetime
 * compressed-bytes cache. Pattern: component_text_area/tag_endpoint.ts (the
 * in-repo ETag/If-None-Match precedent), generalized to on-disk files.
 *
 * PRODUCTION NOTE: nginx owns client statics in the socket topology
 * (engineering/PRODUCTION.md §reverse-proxy) — these headers are the dev/fallback
 * path AND the reference behavior the proxy block mirrors. The 2026-07-09 boot
 * probe measured the gap this closes: TS served 0/25 boot files with
 * validators while the PHP oracle's Apache answered 25/25 conditionals 304.
 *
 * The client tree is re-synced IN PLACE (scripts/sync_client.sh), so client
 * files are NOT content-hashed: text/code assets get `Cache-Control: no-cache`
 * (always revalidate — a 304 costs one RTT, a stale module is a broken
 * client; the client's service worker replays If-None-Match, worker_cache.js),
 * static media a short public max-age. Never `immutable` here.

 * The enforcing Content-Security-Policy for app responses (XSS-02, 2026-07-28

 * (and `'unsafe-hashes'`) from `script-src`: that is what neutralises stored
 * XSS — an injected `<img onerror=…>` / inline `<script>` / `javascript:` URL
 * (component_text_area is CKEditor rich-text, so HTML rides the wire) cannot
 * execute, exactly the compensating control the retired PHP engine shipped and
 * the TS rewrite had dropped. Enforced in-process here (deterministic — not
 * dependent on a reverse-proxy `mod_headers`).
 *
 * Allowances mirror the client's real needs (proven by the PHP policy):
 * `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` (CKEditor + inline style=), external map-tile
 * hosts in `img-src` (Leaflet), `blob:`/`data:` for generated media, workers
 * from `blob:`. Two IMPROVEMENTS over the PHP policy: (1) NO third-party origin
 * in `script-src`, ever — the jsdelivr/huggingface allowances are gone, aligning
 * with the no-remote-code invariant (RC-01); local in-browser models
 * (browser_whisper) load from this install's own /dedalo/ai_models store.
 * `connect-src` carries exactly two classes of CONFIG-DERIVED origin, both
 * naming servers this install already depends on and neither able to supply
 * code: its own media host (MEDIA_CSP_ORIGIN) and its configured update masters
 * (UPDATE_MASTER_CSP_ORIGINS). Nothing is ever hardcoded there.
 * `'unsafe-eval'` stays for the onnxruntime/transformers WASM glue (the active
 * transcription feature) — it does NOT weaken the XSS control above (that rests
 * on no-unsafe-inline); tightening it to `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is a follow-up
 * once the in-browser AI tools are verified under it. The importmap hash is the
 * sha256 of the ONE inline script the page ships (index.html importmap); the
 * xss_csp_tripwire recomputes it so an edit to that block cannot silently break
 * module resolution.

 * The ONE media URL prefix the app may embed, on a split-origin install: the image

 * WHY BOTH (2026-08-24, measured in Chrome, not reasoned). component_image's edit view
 * hosts the server-generated SVG envelope as `<object type="image/svg+xml">`, and an
 * `<object>` that loads a document opens a NESTED BROWSING CONTEXT — which Chrome
 * checks against `frame-src`, not only `object-src`. So on a split-origin install this
 * prefix in `object-src` alone was not enough: the browser reported
 * `Framing 'http://<media host>/' violates … "frame-src 'self' blob:"` and every image
 * in the edit view rendered blank, which is the exact symptom
 * `object-src 'none'` had produced before this constant existed. The two directives
 * must therefore carry the SAME source, from this one definition, or the policy
 * contradicts itself and the contradiction is invisible until a split-origin install
 * opens an image.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE TO FRAME. A nested context executes an SVG's script in the origin it
 * was fetched from. That is why the media host is never handed over WHOLESALE, and why
 * this is path-scoped to the image folder: `svg` is not an image quality and
 * component_image rejects `.svg` uploads, so no uploader bytes land under it — the
 * uploader-supplied population lives under `svg/`, which this prefix excludes. Since
 * MEDIA-03 landed (`WC-2026-08-24-media-svg-response-headers`) the generated
 * Apache/nginx rules also emit the envelope's own restrictive CSP (`script-src 'none'`)
 * and hand every other SVG over as a sandboxed `attachment`, so the framed document is
 * inert at the media origin too — where this comment previously had to record the
 * opposite ("the generated access rules emit no CSP, no sandbox and no
 * Content-Disposition"), which was true until that work.
 *
 * A CSP source whose path ends in `/` is a prefix match (CSP3 §6.6.2.6). Empty when
