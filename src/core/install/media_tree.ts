/**
 * THE MEDIA TREE — one declarative description of the directories a Dédalo
 * install must have under the media root, provisioned idempotently with ONE
 * permission mode, plus a verification pass.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (audit 2026-08_oh1_beta §5.2). PHP provisioned the whole tree
 * at boot (`core/base/dd_init_test.php`, the media block: root → per-type
 * quality folders → posterframe/subtitles → html_files → export → upload tmp →
 * import). The rewrite ported only the media ROOT (`install/directories.ts`), so
 * every sub-folder was minted ad-hoc by whichever writer ran first — with
 * inconsistent modes (`media/atomic.ts`, `media/av_versions.ts` and
 * `media/file_ops.ts` use 0775; `media/protection.ts` and
 * `ontology/ontology_update.ts` use 0750) — and nothing ever verified the tree.
 *
 * The visible casualty was `media/av/subtitles`: NO writer creates it (PHP made
 * it at boot and `build_subtitles_file` assumes it), so tool_transcription's VTT
 * builder refused on every TS-provisioned install and subtitles could not be
 * produced at all.
 *
 * DESIGN
 *
 *  - `mediaTreeEntries()` is the SINGLE description. Every entry carries the
 *    `reason` it must exist and the `consumer` that reads/writes it, so an
 *    omission can never be silent and a future subsystem never has to invent an
 *    ad-hoc `mkdirSync` again. Ancestors are expanded automatically, so no level
 *    of the tree is left to a `recursive:true` side effect at an umask-decided
 *    mode.
 *  - Everything is derived from the typed config (`config.media.*`, the catalog
 *    readers) and the `concepts/media.ts` accessor — never a hardcoded quality or
 *    folder string, never `process.env`. An install that renames a tier gets its
 *    tier, and an install that renames a FOLDER gets its folder: the three names
 *    PHP kept configurable (`DEDALO_IMAGE_WEB_FOLDER`, `DEDALO_HTML_FILES_FOLDER`,
 *    `DEDALO_TOOL_EXPORT_FOLDER_PATH`) were hardcoded here until 2026-08-09 and
 *    now come from `src/config/catalog/media.ts` like everything else. The two
 *    folder names PHP itself wrote as literals in `dd_init_test` (`import`,
 *    `import/history`) are the only ones left, declared once in
 *    `PHP_LEGACY_FOLDERS` below.
 *  - CREATE is idempotent and uses exactly `MEDIA_DIR_MODE`; the mode is forced
 *    with a `chmod` after the `mkdir` so a process umask cannot make one install
 *    differ from the next.
 *  - VERIFY REPORTS, IT DOES NOT REPAIR SURPRISES. A missing directory is
 *    created (that is provisioning); a path that exists but is a FILE, a dangling
 *    symlink, unwritable, or carries a different mode is REPORTED. Silently
 *    chmod-ing a live archive's media tree can break the web server's own access
 *    to it, so an operator decides.
 *  - VERIFY WRITES NOTHING except on the three nodes PHP itself write-probed.
 *    PHP's `system::check_directory` is `is_dir()` + `mkdir()` — it never probed
 *    writability — and only DEDALO_UPLOAD_TMP_DIR and `<media>/import` got the
 *    extra two-level check (a literal `test` SUBDIRECTORY, which PHP then left
 *    behind forever). Probing every node instead would put a probe file AND a
 *    probe directory into ~50 directories of a live archive on every boot, and a
 *    killed process would leave exactly the residue this module exists to end.
 *    The probe is therefore per-entry and declared (`MediaTreeEntry.probe`).
 *
 * BOOT, NOT INSTALL. `provisionMediaTreeAtBoot()` is the production entry point
 * and `src/server.ts` calls it on every start: PHP ran `dd_init_test` on EVERY
 * REQUEST, so a box that was installed before this module existed — i.e. every
 * existing install — would otherwise never get `av/subtitles` at all. It is
 * idempotent, costs one `stat` per declared directory, and NEVER throws: a broken
 * media root must be loud, not a refusal to boot (S1-15).
 *
 * PARITY NOTE — the tree deliberately declares MORE than PHP's, never less:
 * every type gets a `thumb` tier (THUMB_IS_UNIVERSAL — PHP appended one to pdf
 * only, but this engine builds thumbs for all five models), `av/audio_tr` is the
 * TS-native transcription derivative, and `image/svg` is the vector-annotation
 * envelope (`media/svg_overlay.ts`). The PHP-legacy folders with no TS consumer
 * yet (`image/web`, `html_files`, `export/files`, `import`) are kept so an
 * install's shape stays recognisable to an operator and so nothing has to create
 * them ad-hoc later; each says so in its own `consumer: null` + `reason`.
 *
 * THE BOOT BUDGET (`MEDIA_TREE_BOOT_BUDGET_MS`). The pass is ~50 `stat`s and 3
 * write probes — 2.3 ms on local storage, and PHP ran the equivalent on every
 * REQUEST, so this is already strictly cheaper than the oracle. It is not free on
 * NETWORK storage, which is a real heritage deployment: at 200 ms of NFS latency
 * the same walk is ten seconds of a boot that looks hung. `provisionMediaTree`
 * therefore accepts a wall-clock budget, checked before each entry, and the boot
 * pass always passes one: when it runs out the walk STOPS, records a `timed_out`
 * problem naming the entry it stopped at and how many were unchecked, and the
 * server goes on to serve (S1-15 — a slow media volume is not a reason for the
 * archive not to open; the unreached entries are provisioned on the next start).
 *
 * WHY A BUDGET AND NOT ASYNC I/O. Making the walk `fs/promises` + a `Promise.race`
 * would let the boot continue while a look-up is outstanding, and it is the wrong
 * trade twice over. (1) It buys nothing for the case it appears to solve: a hard
 * network mount whose server is down blocks the syscall inside the kernel, so the
 * timer fires while the WORKER THREAD stays parked forever — ~50 of them would
 * exhaust the fs threadpool and spread the hang to every other file consumer in
 * the process, converting one broken mount into a broken server. The honest fix
 * for an unreachable mount is a mount option, and the config doc says so. (2) The
 * pass has to finish before `writeRuleFiles()` (those files are written INTO the
 * media root) and before the first request, or a request can observe a
 * half-provisioned tree. A bounded synchronous pass keeps that ordering by
 * construction; an unawaited async one silently loses it.
 *
 * Ledger: engineering/wire_contract/WC-2026-08-09-media-tree-boot-provisioning.md
 * and WC-2026-08-09-media-tree-configurable-folders-and-boot-budget.md.

/**
 * THE PRODUCTION ENTRY POINT — the per-BOOT provisioning pass, called from

 *
 * WHY BOOT AND NOT THE INSTALLER. PHP ran `dd_init_test` on every request, so an
 * install acquired new tree folders the moment the engine declared them. The
 * rewrite's installer step only ever runs during an INSTALL, and every existing
 * oral-history box is long past it — wiring the tree to the installer alone would
 * leave `av/subtitles` missing on exactly the machines the audit was about.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS and never refuses the boot (S1-15 posture): a media root that
 * cannot be provisioned is an operator problem to shout about, not a reason for
 * the archive to stop serving records. Returns null when there is nothing to
 * report against (no media root configured, or the pass itself failed).
 *
 * QUIET WHEN HEALTHY: one `stat` per declared directory plus three write probes,
 * and no output at all when the tree is complete and consistent.
 *
 * BOUNDED: unlike the installer pass, this one always carries a wall-clock budget
 * (`MEDIA_TREE_BOOT_BUDGET_MS`, 5 s by default), because it sits between the
 * process starting and the socket being bound. See the header for why the answer
 * is a budget on a synchronous walk rather than async I/O with a timer.
