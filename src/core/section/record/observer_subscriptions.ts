/**
 * OBSERVER SUBSCRIPTION REGISTRY (Act 2, 2026-08-02; allowlist removed same
 * day) — ontology-derived edge discovery, replacing forward-only discovery.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: discovery used to read ONLY the saved component's
 * `properties.observers` (PHP-identical), so an observer edge had to be
 * declared TWICE — forward on the observed node (`observers`) and reverse on
 * the observer node (`observe`) — and a missing half was DEAD CONFIG that
 * failed silently (the rsc19 -> oh28 report; 9 reverse-only edges measured
 * inert on the live ontology). The registry is built over the WHOLE ontology
 * (`getNodesWithProperty('observers') ∪ getNodesWithProperty('observe')`), so
 * ONE declaration is enough.
 *
 * THE DISPATCH RULE (owner ruling 2026-08-02, replacing the transitional
 * hand-written activation table): an edge dispatches iff the OBSERVER declares
 * it in `properties.observe` with a `server` block — plus wildcard edges
 * compiled from forward specs (below). No code table gates it. Standard
 * observer semantics: THE SUBSCRIBER REGISTERS ITSELF; the observed node does
 * not maintain a list of who watches it. "The good configuration is set into
 * the observe property on the observer — the observed does not need to say
 * 'X is calling me'." Requiring the forward mirror was the inversion that
 * produced every dead edge in this subsystem; a hardcoded activation list
 * would have converted an ontology decision into a code decision — same
 * inversion, different file. The per-edge kill switch is therefore an
 * ONTOLOGY EDIT (blank the observe entry's `server` key), never a code table.
 *
 * HOST-SECTION RESOLUTION ("which section's records do I recompute?" — the
 * one thing a reverse declaration may not carry implicitly), in order:
 *   1. the `observe` entry's OWN `section_tipo` — ontology, on the observer:
 *      the authoring home for new edges (nothing uses it yet);
 *   2. the forward spec's `section_tipo` (when a forward spec exists and
 *      names a real scope — not the literal 'self'). NOT redundant with the
 *      observer's own section: a component declared ONCE can be REUSED across
 *      sections — measured: rsc387 declares observer hierarchy93 three times
 *      with section_tipo on1/ts1/dc1 while hierarchy93's own ontology
 *      position is section hierarchy20 (9 of 64 mirrored edges are like
 *      this). Those edges must NEVER be silently retargeted to the observer's
 *      own section;
 *   3. the observer's OWN SECTION (its dd_ontology ancestor chain —
 *      getAncestorSectionTipo), refined by the SQO filter path when the entry
 *      carries one: virtual and real sections are EQUIVALENT (a virtual
 *      section's relations[0].tipo names its real section — resolver.ts /
 *      getSectionRealTipo), so a filter path naming numisdata5 under an
 *      observer whose own section is numisdata276 is NOT ambiguous — they are
 *      the same section, and the path's face (the virtual tipo) is the one
 *      the stored records carry, so it wins. A path naming a NON-equivalent
 *      section resolves to nothing (never a silent retarget);
 *   4. unresolved → the consumer REFUSES LOUDLY, naming the edge and telling
 *      the author to add a section scope to the observe entry (validator RED
 *      too — `hostUnresolved`). Nothing hits this on the current ontology.
 *
 * THE 'all' WILDCARD IS COMPILED, NEVER INTERPRETED AS "EVERY SAVE" — and it
 * is the SOLE residual dependency on the forward `observers` array (beyond
 * rule-2 host targeting): an `observe` entry with `component_tipo:'all'` is a
 * MATCHING rule with NO intrinsic scope, so the forward specs naming the
 * observer are the only thing bounding it. The builder compiles it into
 * exactly that edge set (3 edges on the live ontology:
 * numisdata282->numisdata250, numisdata1451->numisdata257, tch555->tch557) in
 * pass 1 ONLY — pass 2 `continue`s on 'all', so a wildcard NEVER mints an
 * edge without a forward spec. A wildcard with zero forward-declarers (or
 * every declarer shadowed by an earlier exact entry in the first-match law)
 * admits ZERO edges and is a RED diagnostic. Inventing a scope semantic here
 * would silently widen these observers to every save in the system.
 *
 * WHERE VIOLATIONS SURFACE (the honest coverage map): the DEC-12 gates
 * (test/unit/observer_subscriptions_native.test.ts) turn violations RED on
 * whatever ontology the suite runs against — the dedicated suite DB, a strict
 * subset of a production install's ontology. An edge authored ONLY in a
 * production ontology surfaces OPERATIONALLY: the boot probe (server.ts warms
 * this registry at startup, logging every violation against the real ontology
 * on every deploy/restart), the `observers_registry` ops gauge + the
 * `observers_registry_contract_violations` counter on GET /api/v1/counters.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE: built lazily on first use, cached process-wide through
 * createOntologyCache — the invalidation hub clears it after EVERY dd_ontology
 * write (deferred to COMMIT inside a transaction), so REGISTRATION is by
 * construction and this is a legal module-level cache. Two windows are closed
 * explicitly on top of that: (1) the SEED RACE — a concurrent dd_ontology
 * COMMIT can fire the clearers between this builder's reads and its cache
 * write, so a build token planted before the reads (cleared by the same hub
 * fire) guards the seed: if the token did not survive, the index is served to
 * the caller but never cached; (2) the IN-TRANSACTION rebuild loop — S1-14
 * forbids seeding the shared cache from an ambient transaction (the build may
 * observe uncommitted rows), and a cold-cache import (one tx per row, the
 * dispatch running inside it) would otherwise rebuild per component save, so
 * in-tx builds memoize on the TRANSACTION-scoped memo (postgres.ts
 * getTransactionMemo) — one build per tx span, dying with the transaction.
 * The built index is deep-frozen AND its Maps runtime-hardened (Object.freeze
 * alone does not seal Map internals — the mutators are shadowed to throw);
 * a stale index is rebuilt on the next miss, never patched.
 *
 * CONSUMERS: ./observers.ts (dispatch + the cascade leaf pre-gate) and
 * ./observer_reconcile.ts (tuple discovery — previously its own third copy of
 * forward-only discovery). The contract validator below is shared between the
 * runtime build (loud log + counter, never a throw — saves must not die on a
 * malformed user ontology) and the DEC-12 gates (where violations are RED).
