/**
 * THE DECLARED COMPONENTS OF A SECTION — the ONE census shared by the record
 * WIPE (delete_record.ts deleteSectionData: every component it may empty) and
 * the covered-slot RESTORE (section_record/record_write.ts
 * requestCoveredSlotRecompute: every covered observer slot it must recompute).
 * Two censuses drifted: the restore walked the own subtree without crossing
 * nested sections and fell back to the real section only when the own subtree
 * held NO component, while the wipe crossed them — so a slot the wipe emptied
 * could be one the restore never recomputed (left wiped-empty until a
 * reconcile). One function, so they cannot diverge again.
 *
 * THE SET: the section's own component subtree ∪ its REAL section's
 * (getSectionRealTipo — a virtual section's records store the real section's
 * components even when the virtual one declares a component of its own), each
 * walk CROSSING nested section/area nodes (PHP delete_data empties every
 * declared component key of the record). Deduplicated by tipo, own first, in
 * ontology order.
