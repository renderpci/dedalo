/**
 * TEMPORAL instances — a tool's throwaway editable clone (WC-059).
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: a temporal instance ADDRESSES NO RECORD. The `section_id` it
 * carries is a client-side sentinel (1), not an address, and every door must
 * treat it as such: the save resolves and echoes, it never persists; the read
 * resolves CONTEXT with an empty value, it never reads the record.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The client has shipped `source.is_temporal` since PHP
 * commit 5c45c71ebb (2026-01-31), where it selected `matrix_temp_manager` — a
 * `(section_tipo, user)`-keyed row in the unlogged `temp` table — so writes went
 * to a scratch store. The TS rewrite carried the five client call sites over and
 * did NOT port the store; `rqoSourceSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so the flag rode
 * along unread and `saveComponentData({sectionId: Number(source.section_id)})`
 * wrote the sentinel straight onto the REAL record 1 of the target section —
 * value replaced, Time Machine row appended, modified-stamp falsified, and for
 * relations an orphan target record created. Un-ledgered until 2026-07-28.
 *
 * WHY `saveComponentData` IS NOT MADE POLYMORPHIC. Teaching the persisted engine
 * a second store would refactor the most load-bearing write path in the codebase
 * (row lock, counter, relation index, TM) to serve a write that must not happen
 * at all. That still holds — the scratch store is a SEPARATE module over a
 * SEPARATE table, and this door still reaches no matrix write engine.
 *
 * (!) THE STORAGE HALF OF WC-059 IS SUPERSEDED BY WC-079 (2026-07-30). The old
 * text argued "nothing ever reads the value back out of it". True of the
 * propagate tool, which sends `component_to_propagate.data.entries` straight from
 * client memory — but FALSE of service_tmp_section, whose children autoload
 * (`element_instance.build(true)`), so every render re-read through this door,
 * got `entries: []`, and silently wiped the "Values" form the operator had filled
 * in: tool_import_files lost the metadata for a whole import batch on any reload.
 *
 * So a TS-native scratch store now exists — `./temporal_store.ts`, which owns its
 * own table and is the only module allowed to name it (sql_confinement T4). What
 * did NOT change is the invariant: a temporal instance still addresses no record,
 * and nothing here writes to matrix record 1, its Time Machine or its activity
 * rows.
 *
 * The store is OPT-IN and keyed by (user_id, scope, section_tipo, tipo, lang).
 * Opt-in because only service_tmp_section wants persistence: the propagate tool
 * seeds its clone from the OPEN record and then bulk-writes across a whole search
 * result set, and the two component_text_area pickers are transient — a restored
 * value in either would be a stale locator stamped into a tag, or a stale payload
 * propagated over real records. The opt-in rides `source.temporal_scope`, NOT
 * `is_temporal`: that flag means "addresses no record" and has exactly ONE reader
 * by tripwire, so giving it a second meaning is the very mistake WC-059 was.
 * `scope` also repairs PHP's key, which was per (section_tipo, user) and so
 * collided whenever two tools were open on the same section.
 *
 * The producers (all client-side, frozen by the tripwire's allowlist):
 *   tools/tool_propagate_component_data/js/tool_propagate_component_data.js
 *   client/dedalo/core/services/service_tmp_section/js/service_tmp_section.js
 *   client/dedalo/core/component_text_area/js/render_draw.js
 *   client/dedalo/core/component_text_area/js/render_reference.js
 *   client/dedalo/core/section/js/view_graph_solved_section.js
 *
 * Gate: test/unit/temporal_instance_tripwire.test.ts.

/**
 * NORMALIZE a LITERAL temporal component's entries for the echo.
 *
 * (!) THE DELTA IS NOT RE-APPLIED, and that is the whole subtlety of this door.
 * The persisted engine seeds from the LOCKED MATRIX ROW and applies
 * `changed_data` to it (`save_component.ts` applySaveComponentData) — it
 * structurally cannot double-apply. A temporal instance has no row to seed from,
 * so the only base available is `data.entries` from the request — and the client
 * has ALREADY applied the delta to that: `component_common.prototype.change_value`
 * (:1272-1278) runs `update_data_value` for every changed_data item, mutating
 * `self.data.entries` in place, and only THEN calls `save(changed_data)`, which
 * ships `clone(self.data)` (:663-664). So `data.entries` is the POST-delta state.
 *
 * Re-applying it here would: fail every `remove` (the item is already gone, and
 * the engine's "unknown id" rule would 400 the user's deletion), duplicate every
 * `insert`, and append on every `update`. Only `set_data` — which replaces
 * wholesale — is idempotent, which is exactly why the first version of this door
 * looked correct against a set_data-only gate.
 *
 * What DOES still have to happen is the normalization the persisted path performs
 * on the way to storage, because the echo becomes the client's next `self.data`:
 * the lang stamp and the item-id mint. Without the id mint an id-less item stays
 * id-less, so the next `update` arrives with `id: null` and appends instead of
 * replacing — the array grows on every committed edit, and for
 * tool_propagate_component_data that array is what gets written across every
 * matched record.
 *
 * The relation branch needs no equivalent: `mergeRelationChips` is idempotent
 * under both orderings (its insert path dedups by locator, its remove path is a
 * filter), which is why the same payload shape is safe there.
 *
 * Returns a message instead of throwing so the door answers 400 with the reason.
