/**
 * Section record duplication (PHP dd_core_api::duplicate →
 * section_record::duplicate).
 *
 * A duplicate is a NEW record (fresh counter-allocated section_id, fresh audit
 * metadata) carrying a copy of the source's component data. Empirically
 * verified against live PHP (test2 fixtures):
 * - `data` column: fresh metadata, NOT copied (build_metadata);
 * - copied columns: every jsonb column except data/meta/relation_search, with
 *   the audit component tipos (dd197/dd199/dd200/dd201) dropped — they get
 *   fresh stamps instead — and covered-observer mirror slots dropped too
 *   (derived "who references me" state; empty by construction on a fresh
 *   record — see isCoveredObserverTipo, Phase-0 disarm 2026-08-02);
 * - audit stamps: created dd200/dd199 AND modified dd197/dd201 all point at the
 *   duplicating user "now" (the per-component re-save loop stamps modification
 *   data on top of the creation stamps);
 * - `meta`: [{count: maxItemId}] per COPIED component tipo (the re-save loop's
 *   counter shape — array-wrapped, PHP canonical);
 * - Time Machine: one audit row per copied component tipo with the DATA-LANG
 *   slice of the copied value (nolan slice for non-translatable components);
 * - post-write obligations: declared ONCE, LAST, through the write chokepoint's
 *   own hook (afterRecordWrite — save event, security reaction, RAG index
 *   event; this writer bypasses record_write.ts, so it declares the same
 *   obligations for itself rather than remembering them one by one — a
 *   duplicated dd1324 row clones a tool's name + active flag into the registry,
 *   and a duplicate is born carrying the FULL content of its source, so it must
 *   reach the vector store like any other record, P1-8 / DATA-18) — and the
 *   observer cascade: the hook declares the clone's BIRTH to the obligation
 *   ledger (section_record/obligation_ledger.ts), so every target the copied
 *   relation locators point at recomputes its mirror (the clone is a new
 *   referencer of each); then ONE
 *   'NEW' activity row (P1-8 / DATA-19 — the closed WHAT vocabulary has no
 *   DUPLICATE code; PHP logged per-component SAVE rows from the re-save loop,
 *   this engine logs the record's birth with `source_section_id` —
 *   engineering/wire_contract/WC-2026-09-03-duplicate-record-new-activity-row.md
 *   records the divergence from the oracle's per-component shape). Gated by
 *   test/unit/tools_cache_invalidation.test.ts +
 *   test/unit/write_obligations_{tripwire,native}.test.ts.
 *
 * Media-file duplication (engineering/MEDIA_SPEC.md Phase B; CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2
 * CORE-5, WC-2026-09-30-media-key-locked-transform): the clone NEVER stores the
 * source's index. Its media items are inserted with `files_info: []` (an
 * external item keeps its URL entries), so neither the committed row nor its
 * history can name the SOURCE record's files, even if the process dies right
 * after the insert. The files are then copied through the record-scoped walk
 * (media/file_ops.ts duplicateSectionMediaFiles — the `additional_path` bucket
 * of THIS record honoured), and the clone's index is re-scanned AT THE CLONE'S
 * IDENTITY through the one locked media-key writer (files_info_persist.ts
 * transformStoredMediaItems), always, even after a failed copy; the written
 * items feed the history rows. A copy that is not complete — a refused bucket,
 * a failed copy, fewer files copied than the source's index claimed — is a
 * VERDICT, never a throw (the row is already committed): logged as
 * `media.operation_failed`, counted (`duplicate_media_incomplete`), and returned
 * by duplicateSectionRecordWithVerdict. LEDGERED: media derivative
 * REGENERATION (we copy existing derivatives, not rebuild them).
 *
 * Dataframe frame targets are RE-MINTED, never shared
 * (WC-2026-08-27-duplicate-reminted-dataframe-targets, closing DATA-05): a
 * dd490 pairing locator OWNS the record it addresses — the frame's fields
 * live there — so copying it verbatim (what PHP does, and what this file did)
 * left ONE frame target pointed at by two main items on two records, and a
 * curator correcting the copy's frame silently rewrote the original's. See
 * remintDataframeTargets: every frame target is deep-copied through this same
 * writer and the copied locator re-pointed, or the duplicate is REFUSED. There
 * is no third option: a duplicate that shares some frames is corruption that
 * nothing detects. NARROWED to frames that name a Dedalo record address: an
 * external remote id or an absent one owns nothing, so it is copied verbatim
 * exactly as before (frameTargetAddress).
 *
 * Re-minting MINTS RECORDS IN A SECTION THE CALLER NEVER NAMED, so this writer
 * re-asks the write grant (level 2) on every frame target's section for the
 * duplicating user — the doors above gate the HOST section alone, and nothing
 * in a duplicate request mentions the target section at all. See
 * assertFrameTargetDuplicable.
 *
 * NOT ATOMIC, AND SAID OUT LOUD (2026-08-28, CLI-01 / P0-10). This writer opens
 * NO transaction. The clone COMMITS at step 4 (insertMatrixRecordWithCounter is
 * a single autocommit statement), and steps 3b, 4b, 5 and 6 — frame-target
 * re-minting, media file copies (never a throw: a verdict), the two Time Machine
 * rows per component, and afterRecordWrite with the observer cascade it carries —
 * run outside any transaction, before and after that commit. Consequences a
 * caller must know:
 *
 *   - A THROW HERE DOES NOT MEAN NOTHING HAPPENED. A failure at step 5 leaves a
 *     committed duplicate with no history; a failure at step 6 leaves one whose
 *     targets' observer mirrors do not know about it. This is precisely why the
 *     idempotency gate (api/dispatch.ts, Gate 4) refuses to re-execute after a
 *     thrown handler and answers `idempotency.outcome_unknown` instead: freeing
 *     the key would let the transport's automatic resend mint a SECOND clone of
 *     a heritage record.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT SIMPLY WRAPPED IN withTransaction, verified rather than assumed
 * — a naive wrap would introduce a WORSE defect than the one it closes:
 *
 *   1. THE COUNTER ROLLS BACK, THE FILES DO NOT. The id comes from a ROW in
 *      `matrix_counter` (matrix_write.ts: `ON CONFLICT (tipo) DO UPDATE SET
 *      value = value + 1`), not from a sequence — so a ROLLBACK returns the
 *      counter to its previous value and the NEXT duplicate is handed the SAME
 *      section_id. Media file names embed that id
 *      (media/path.ts: `{component_tipo}_{section_tipo}_{section_id}`), and a
 *      filesystem copy is not transactional, so the rolled-back attempt's files
 *      would be ADOPTED by the next record to receive that id: a photograph
 *      silently attached to the wrong object, which nothing detects.
 *   2. THE MEDIA WRITE-BACK IS A LOCKED TRANSFORM of its own (one short
 *      transaction per component — files_info_persist.ts refuses to run inside a
 *      caller's), and the observer cascade drains after COMMIT through the
 *      obligation ledger either way — neither can simply ride one outer
 *      transaction.
 *
 * The structurally correct form is therefore not "add withTransaction" but a
 * SPLIT: a transaction covering step 3b's re-mints + the insert + the Time
 * Machine rows, with the media copies and afterRecordWrite moved strictly AFTER
 * the commit (so a rollback can never leave a file addressed by a reusable id). That is a restructure of the engine's most
 * delicate write path and belongs with its own gate, in its own change — it must
 * not ride along inside an idempotency fix, and it does not remove the need for
 * the ambiguous-outcome rule, which stands as long as ANY committed work can be
 * followed by a throw.
