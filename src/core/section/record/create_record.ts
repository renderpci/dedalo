/**
 * Section record creation (PHP section::create_record → section_record::create).
 *
 * Creating a record writes ONE new matrix row with the audit metadata a fresh
 * record carries:
 * - the `data` column: {label, created_date, section_id, section_tipo,
 *   diffusion_info, created_by_user_id} (PHP section_record::build_metadata);
 * - the `relation` column: the created-by-user locator under dd200 (a link to
 *   the user record in dd128);
 * - the `date` column: the creation date under dd199 as a Dédalo virtual-date
 *   object (PHP build_modification_data mode 'new_record').
 * The section_id is allocated atomically through the matrix counter (see
 * insertMatrixRecordWithCounter).
 *
 * created_date / the dd199 date are wall-clock values — the only non-reproducible
 * fields; a differential must normalize them.
 *
 * This writer inserts through db/matrix_write.ts DIRECTLY — it does NOT pass the
 * record_write.ts chokepoint — so it declares the chokepoint's post-write
 * obligations for itself through the chokepoint's OWN hook (afterRecordWrite:
 * save event, security reaction, RAG index event) and appends the 'NEW'
 * activity row here, at the engine (PHP section::create_record :1159 logged at
 * the engine too, so every door — client, MCP, import, portal "+" — gets a
 * row). Gated by test/unit/tools_cache_invalidation.test.ts +
 * test/unit/write_obligations_{tripwire,native}.test.ts.

 *
 * THE GENERATION FENCE (`explicitId`). A counter allocation opens its epoch in
 * the INSERT itself (matrix_write.ts); the matrix-level explicit-id insert opens
 * none. But THIS door only ever creates a NEW record (an undelete re-inserts
 * through tool_time_machine's insertMatrixRecordIfAbsent, never here), so an

 * REBIRTH, bulk run or not, and opens the epoch. The generation epoch is what
 * the bulk revert trusts to tell a cascade-deleted record from one born at its
 * address since (bulk_revert_records.ts isRebornSince) — a door that re-used an
 * address without opening one would let the revert pour the dead record's
 * snapshot into the new one (2026-09-27 review). For a BULK create the stake is
 * also the undo log: a record is being born where a dead one lived (a CSV
 * re-imported with its section_id column after the record was deleted), and
 * the dead record's undo log — an
 * earlier run's birth marker and B/A pairs, byte-identical when the same CSV is
 * imported again — must not read as the new record's: reverting that earlier
 * run would restore its BEFORE (absent) over every key of this run and delete
 * the record (the chain and conflict checks cannot tell two records with the
 * same content apart). So the epoch is opened here, in the insert's
 * transaction, BEFORE the marker — the marker sits at or above it
 * (recordBulkBirth's contract). A no-op on a fresh address.

 * misses every non-rendering door (import, ts_api, MCP, the portal "+") and
 * left a non-admin's new record outside the projects ACL — invisible in list
 * and search, 403 on every save. One INSERT carries them, so the record is
 * never momentarily unreachable and no Time Machine row records a "change"
 * that is really the record's birth state.
 *
 * `options.filterData` supplies the project locators explicitly (PHP
 * set_projects_to_new_section_record's `$component_filter_data` branch — the
 * portal "+" inherits the HOST record's projects instead of the computed
 * default).
 *
 * THERE IS NO PER-DOOR OPT-OUT, deliberately. A record's ontology-declared
 * birth state does not depend on which door made it, and an opt-out is exactly
 * the silent narrowing this module exists to end: the ontology/hierarchy
 * provisioners would mint node records structurally different from the ones a
 * curator makes, and the difference would surface as "this node has no project"
 * months later. Where a provisioner means the opposite of a declared default it
 * OVERWRITES it explicitly (hierarchy_provision's `ontology30` on the model
 * twin), which is legible in the code that means it.

	//    EXISTS, which is what the data-derived caches (datalist option lists,
	//    authorized projects, hierarchy targets …) enumerate. For the three tool
	//    sections a bare create used to be inert because every tools reader
	//    skips a nameless row AND fetchActiveToolRows filters on the dd1354
	//    active relation — but that second half is GONE since the birth
	//    defaults landed: dd1324/dd996 declare `dato_default` on dd1354, so a
	//    fresh tool-register row is now born ACTIVE (still nameless, so still
	//    skipped). "Inert because of what the readers happen to select" was
	//    never an invariant anyone maintained; "every dd1324/dd996/dd234 write
	//    reaches invalidateAllToolCaches" is. Over-invalidation is cheap and
	//    harmless; a missed hop is permanent staleness.
	//  - the security reaction: the birth keys (dd200/dd199 + defaults) can
	//    never be an account transition; the reaction no-ops on every section
	//    but dd128/dd234 and clears caches there.
	//  - the RAG index event (DATA-18): a born-empty record enqueues cheaply
	//    (ON CONFLICT dedupes in the queue) and uniformly — the alternative was
	//    one lifecycle door exempt "because it is nearly harmless".
	//  - the observer ledger (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2): the record's BIRTH — its
	//    relation defaults (a projects filter, a `dato_default` locator) are new
	//    edges, and every target an observer mirrors must list the record; a
