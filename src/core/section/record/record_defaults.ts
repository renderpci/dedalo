/**
 * RECORD BIRTH DEFAULTS — the ontology-declared initial state a record is born
 * with (audit 2026-08_oh1_beta B1 + §5.1).
 *
 * Three seeds, one chokepoint:
 *
 * 1. THE PROJECT LOCATOR (component_filter). The projects ACL filters every
 *    read and every per-record write gate by the record's component_filter
 *    locators. A record created WITHOUT one is outside every non-admin's
 *    scope: invisible in list and search, 403 "Record is out of the user
 *    scope" on save, un-openable, un-deletable. Every PHP-era oh1 record
 *    carries its oh22; TS-created ones did not — that is blocker B1.
 *
 * 2. `properties.dato_default` (PHP component_common::set_data_default,
 *    class.component_common.php:753-869). The ontology declares a component's
 *    initial value (oh21 Quality, oh93 Review status, oh32 publication "No",
 *    the hierarchy colour …). It was implemented NOWHERE in src/, so those
 *    seeds never landed. This is a GENERIC facility keyed off the component's
 *    ontology properties — never a per-model special case.
 *
 * 3. THE ONTOLOGY TLD (`ontology7`, the ONT-TLD invariant — see
 *    ontology/tld.ts requiredOntologyTld). A record of an ontology node section
 *    `<tld>0` MUST declare `ontology7 = <tld>`; without it the record parses to
 *    nothing and never appears in the ontology tree. Like seed 1 and unlike
 *    seed 2, it cannot ride on `dato_default` because it is not a constant —
 *    it is a function of the section.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHOKEPOINT DOES NOT COVER. Every door that inserts through the
 * engine passes here — the section-list "+", the tree "+", the portal "+",
 * materialize-on-save, both imports, both MCP write tools, portalize. The
 * COPY-based ontology doors do NOT: ontology/data_io_import.ts and
 * ontology/ontology_update.ts stream rows straight into matrix_ontology with
 * `psql`, bypassing the engine entirely. ONT-TLD is enforced for those by
 * data_io_import's own post-COPY normalizeOntologyTld, and any residue is
 * reported by ontology_state's `tldless` drift. Do not read this module as
 * "every row in the database went through here".
 *
 * WHERE PHP DOES IT, AND WHY WE DO NOT COPY THAT (WC-2026-08-09-record-birth-defaults). PHP seeds on the
 * first EDIT-FORM BUILD: component_common's constructor calls
 * set_data_default() whenever mode='edit' and section_id > 0, so the value is
 * written as a side effect of RENDERING. (The v6 create-time twin,
 * section::set_projects_to_new_section_record, survives in the frozen tree as
 * private DEAD CODE — nothing calls it.) A render side-effect is the wrong
 * chokepoint: it misses every non-rendering door (import, ts_api, MCP, the
 * portal "+"), it writes on read, and it needs its own permission gate because
 * a read-only user can open an edit form. Seeding at the CREATE DOOR covers
 * every door once, at the moment the record's identity is established, by a
 * caller the create gate has already proven may write here.
 *
 * THE FILTER CASCADE (PHP component_filter::get_default_data_for_user,
 * class.component_filter.php:302-470), in PHP's effective order:
 *   - a NON-global-admin with dd170 projects → their FIRST project. (PHP
 *     phrases this as a backstop: "if none of the computed defaults is inside
 *     the user's projects, append the first one" — with tiers 1-2 inert, the
 *     computed set is empty, so the backstop IS the answer.)
 *   - everyone else (global admin, or a non-admin with NO projects) →
 *     DEDALO_DEFAULT_PROJECT / DEDALO_FILTER_SECTION_TIPO_DEFAULT, read
 *     through the typed config. There is no hardcoded locator in this engine.
 *
 * TWO PHP TIERS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT, both inert in the frozen oracle:
 *   - CONFIG_DEFAULT_FILE_PATH (a per-install JSON override file): the define
 *     is commented out in every shipped config, so the tier never ran. It has
 *     no config key here; adding one is a feature request, not parity.
 *   - component_filter's own `properties` tier: PHP guards it with
 *     `isset($properties->data_default)` but reads `$properties->dato_default`
 *     — and NO dd_ontology row in any install carries `data_default` (verified
 *     across dedalo7ts/dedalo7_mht: 0 rows vs 44/66 `dato_default` rows). The
 *     branch is unreachable in the oracle, so component_filter resolves
 *     through the cascade above rather than its declared `dato_default`.
 *     Reproducing the typo would be pointless; honouring the property instead
 *     would silently move existing installs' new records into a different
 *     project. Parity wins.
 *
 * NORMALIZATION IS GENERIC — THERE IS NO MODEL WHITELIST. PHP does not persist
 * `dato_default` verbatim: it goes through component_common::set_data
 * (:918-1010), which is model-agnostic and does exactly three things —
 *   (1) a non-object element is wrapped into `{value: …}`;
 *   (2) `lang` is stamped ONLY when the class declares supports_translation
 *       (component_string_common subclasses + component_iri), and only when the
 *       element does not already carry one;
 *   (3) an element without a usable `id` gets one from the per-component
 *       counter (`meta->{tipo}->0->count`),
 * and then hands the element to `validate_data_element`, which has exactly TWO
 * implementations in the whole oracle: the base one (:901) returns it
 * UNCHANGED, and the relation-family one (component_relation_common:1058) fills
 * `type` from the component's relation type, forces `from_component_tipo`,
 * casts section_id to STRING, and REJECTS (logs + drops, never fatal) a
 * bad-formed or duplicate locator.
 *
 * So "component_date", "component_json", "component_number" — every model
 * outside the relation family — is handled by the SAME branch as a literal,
 * minus the lang stamp. An earlier port whitelisted `relation family OR
 * translatable literal` and threw for everything else; that made `dmm1`
 * (three component_date defaults) and `nexus40` (a component_json default)
 * uncreatable through every door on two production installs. A whitelist here
 * is a silent narrowing of capability wearing a loud throw's clothes.
 *
 * The stored twins were byte-verified against real records (oh1 oh21/oh93/oh32,
 * the hierarchy101 colour default, the {id, start:{…}} component_date shape).
