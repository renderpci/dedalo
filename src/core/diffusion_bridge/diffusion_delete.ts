/**
 * Diffusion unpublish on delete (PHP diffusion_delete::delete_record): a
 * deleted record's published copies leave every diffusion target.
 *
 *   - sql / socrata elements → the NATIVE in-process executor registered at
 *     boot (src/diffusion/targets/mariadb/delete_record.ts) receives
 *     [{database_name, table_name, section_ids:[id], section_tipo}] — the
 *     engine wire shape, kept verbatim across the seam;
 *   - rdf / xml / markdown elements → published-file unlinks under the
 *     published-files root — the ONE producer publish uses too
 *     (./published_files.ts, PUB-03): rdf = /rdf/{service}/
 *     {sanitize(rdfName_st_id)}.rdf (+ the legacy '{base}_*.rdf' variants),
 *     xml/markdown = /{type}/{service}/{st}_{id}.{ext}; nothing published →
 *     idempotent success; no root configured → pending;
 *   - TERMINAL targets (PUB-02): a csv/json full-export element (a record
 *     leaves it only by re-publishing), an element without service_name, an
 *     rdf element with no owl:Class for the section, an sql element with no
 *     database/table — none of these ever published a per-record artifact,
 *     or cannot unpublish one. They are ledgered pending WITH a terminal
 *     reason and EXCLUDED from the retry queue, so they can neither starve
 *     it nor pretend to be settled; the public_tier reconcile reports them;
 *   - per-element outcomes land in the dd1758 diffusion log
 *     (matrix_activity_diffusion): unpublished (2) on success,
 *     unpublish_pending (3) on failure — retryPendingDiffusion() re-runs the
 *     pending rows and flips them in place (PHP retry_pending, DIFFU-08
 *     rule: only flip when the retry actually resolved targets). Every retry
 *     stamps the row (misc.dd1758_retry {attempts,last_attempt}) and the
 *     queue is drained least-recently-attempted first, so one row that fails
 *     forever cannot occupy the head for every run (PUB-02);
 *   - DURABLE INTENT (LIFE-07): the record delete writes its pending rows
 *     INSIDE its transaction (ledgerUnpublishIntent) — when target resolution
 *     itself throws, a record-level row — and settles them post-commit
 *     (settleUnpublishIntent). A committed delete therefore always leaves
 *     the debt it owes on the ledger, whatever happens after the commit.
 *
 * No registered executor → DEC-19 loud warning + pending rows (see
 * deleteDiffusionRecord); no targets → silent no-op, matching a fresh
 * install. The old-engine unix-socket/token transport
 * (DEDALO_DIFFUSION_SOCKET_PATH / DEDALO_DIFFUSION_INTERNAL_TOKEN) was
 * retired at the 2026-07-11 cutover (DIFFUSION_PLAN P5 step 3;
 * rewrite/CUTOVER_RUNBOOK.md §5) — the native paths are primary since S2-31.
