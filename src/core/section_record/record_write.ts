/**
 * record_write — THE write chokepoint for key-level and column-level matrix
 * record persistence. TS re-expression of PHP section_record::save_key_data /
 * save_component_data / save / save_column (class.section_record.php:661/:805/
 * :539/:601) as stateless functions.
 *
 * Every writer that persists component keys into a matrix record MUST route
 * through persistRecordKeys (grep-gated by test/unit/section_record.test.ts):
 * that is what guarantees the PHP write contract everywhere —
 *
 *   1. AUDIT MERGE — the record's modified stamps (dd197 modified_by_user
 *      locator + dd201 modified_date) land in the SAME UPDATE statement as the
 *      component value (PHP save_component_data merges the metadata save_path
 *      before ONE update_by_key). Skipped for the Activity section and when no
 *      user is given (PHP build_modification_data :1584).
 *   2. KEY-REMOVAL SEMANTICS — value null removes the key with the exact PHP
 *      end state (oracle-verified): the column keeps '{}' after its last key,
 *      and a NULL column stays NULL (the PHP save_key_data "columns_to_delete"
 *      guard). Implemented inside updateMatrixKeysData via `#-`.
 *   3. SAVE EVENT — dependent caches invalidated after every persist
 *      (save_event.ts).
 *   3b. THE SECURITY REACTION — a write onto a USERS (dd128) or PROFILES (dd234)
 *      record drops the security caches AND, for the four account-transition
 *      components, ends that account's live credentials (security/revocation.ts
 *      reactToRecordComponentWrite). It hangs off THIS chokepoint for the same
 *      reason the audit stamps do: the alternative was one door remembering.
 *      `persistRecordKeys` reached NO invalidation at all, so a password rewritten
 *      through tool_propagate_component_data, a profile restored by the time
 *      machine, or an observer mirror onto dd128 revoked nothing and left every
 *      security cache stale. Two lanes, not one: the cache clears are idempotent
 *      and ride deferPostTransaction, the revocation is destructive and rides the
 *      COMMIT-ONLY lane.
 *   3c. THE RAG SEAM — every persisted write enqueues the record for re-indexing
 *      (PHP save() :988 enqueue_index). It fires from the SAME post-write hook as
 *      the save event (P1-8 / DATA-17, 2026-09-03): before that only
 *      persistRecordColumns and one save branch fired it, so a record delete
 *      rewrote every holder's relation bag through persistRecordKeys and enqueued
 *      NONE of them — the vector store kept naming the deleted target.
 *   3d. ONE HOOK, NOT THREE REMEMBERED CALLS — `afterRecordWrite` is the single
 *      post-write obligation hook of this module: save event + security reaction
 *      + RAG event. Every writer in this module ends in it, and the two record
 *      INSERT doors that bypass this module by design (create_record.ts,
 *      duplicate_record.ts) call it too, so "which obligations does this door
 *      fire" has exactly one answer. Gated by
 *      test/unit/write_obligations_tripwire.test.ts (doors × obligations, census
 *      TOTAL over the raw matrix_write callers) + write_obligations_native.test.ts.
 *   3e. THE DERIVED WRITES (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2 — the obligation ledger,
 *      WC-2026-09-30-record-write-obligation-ledger). The chokepoint OWNS every
 *      derived write of a record write, so no door has one to remember:
 *        - the OBSERVER cascade — every writer here declares WHAT changed
 *          (`observed`, REQUIRED on afterRecordWrite): per key, the value before
 *          (read under the row lock, in the write's transaction) and after; the
 *          ledger (obligation_ledger.ts) drains it after COMMIT;
 *        - the `relation_search` ancestor index — derived from the value in the
 *          SAME UPDATE (relations/save.ts deriveRelationSearch), under the SAVE
 *          law for every writer but the three REMOVAL doors'
 *          (persistRelationRemovalKeys);
 *        - a COVERED OBSERVER slot (a mirror) and its frames are ONE unit
 *          (pinCoveredObserverSlots): a whole-record write over a live row keeps
 *          the live unit; a NEW record's birth stores none; an undelete stores
 *          the snapshot's (its ids pair its frames) — never declared, always
 *          recomputed from truth after COMMIT, whose hop tells the slot's own
 *          observers.
 *      The three escape hatches are separate ENTRY FUNCTIONS, not flag values,
 *      so the write census can see exactly who takes them (write_obligations leg
 *      B4): the removal law (persistRelationRemovalKeys — the three removal
 *      doors), the cascade-owned mirror write (persistObserverMirrorKeys — the
 *      recompute alone) and the component restore (persistRestoredKeys — a
 *      restored covered slot is recomputed, never propagated). A write with no
 *      observed and no indexed key pays nothing: no transaction, no extra read.
 *   4. THE COMPONENT_IMAGE SVG ENVELOPE — a `media`-column write persists any
 *      `svg_file_data` its items carry to the .svg overlay file BEFORE the row
 *      write (PHP component_image::save → create_svg_file, which likewise
 *      precedes parent::save()). It is here, and not in one save door, because
 *      PHP's hook is on the component save every door funnels through; see
 *      media/svg_overlay.ts persistSvgEnvelopesForKeys.
 *
 * The SQL itself stays in db/matrix_write.ts (updateMatrixKeysData /
 * updateMatrixRecord) — this module owns the contract, not the statements.
 *
 * NOT a class on purpose: the PHP class shape (per-request instance singleton,
 * lazy JSON decode) is PHP-runtime machinery — see concepts/section_record.ts
 * for the mapping of the concept onto TS.
