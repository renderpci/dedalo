/**
 * THE OBLIGATION LEDGER — the observer half of every record write, owned by the
 * write chokepoint instead of remembered by the doors (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2:
 * CORE-1; WC-2026-09-30-record-write-obligation-ledger).
 *
 * A record write owes the observer cascade (PHP component_common::Save() →
 * propagate_to_observers): every OBSERVER of a changed key must recompute, and
 * the records a write DROPPED must be visited too — a removed locator's mirror
 * still lists the record, and only its before-image names it. That was a call
 * each door made for itself, and the doors that forgot are the findings: the
 * time machine's whole-record restore and both undelete doors never propagated,
 * so an undeleted referencer was missing from every mirror it feeds until a
 * reconcile, and a restored term brought its mirror slot back VERBATIM.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. `afterRecordWrite` (record_write.ts) declares WHAT changed — a
 * per-key before/after (`keys`, `replace`), a whole record born or gone
 * (`birth`, `death`), or nothing to observe (`none`, `cascade-owned`) — and this
 * module turns it into ONE entry per write:
 *
 *   - `saved` = the value after, `removed` = `removedLocators(before, after)`
 *     (the ONE removed-set rule — the save door, the restores and the undeletes
 *     share it; it used to be two copies kept in step by a test);
 *   - `selfRecompute` = the COVERED OBSERVER slots of a write that must not
 *     declare them (a replace keeps the live mirror, an undelete writes the
 *     snapshot's, a restore its past value): never propagated, recomputed from
 *     truth — and the recompute ALWAYS hops, its own observers' one news of it.
 *
 * WHEN IT DRAINS (B6). Inside a transaction the entry is queued on the
 * COMMIT-ONLY lane (postgres.ts registerCommitAction), ONE registration per
 * write: a ROLLBACK discards it with the state it would have propagated, and a
 * savepoint rollback truncates exactly the entries queued after the savepoint
 * (the commit queue records its savepoint positions). Entries are NEVER
 * coalesced — merging a first before-image with a last after-image loses the
 * target a rolled-back middle write removed. With no transaction at all the
 * entry drains inline. Either way the recompute reads COMMITTED state and opens
 * its own transactions, which is why propagation refuses to run inside one.
 *
 * DEDUP. One CascadeGuard per transaction (its memo, keyed by a module symbol):
 * every entry of one transaction shares its visited/recomputed sets, so a
 * target touched by N writes of one logical operation (a record delete
 * rewriting 1,189 holders) recomputes once. The recompute is idempotent and
 * reads truth, so for FIRST-ORDER mirrors the order entries drain in cannot
 * change the result. LIMIT, stated (execute-once — the ledgered divergence
 * WC-2026-08-02-observer-cascade-bounded-flag): a mirror OF a mirror is read
 * once per operation. When an earlier entry's cascade recomputes it while a
 * LATER entry's restored mirror still holds its snapshot (committed, not yet
 * converged — a save queued before a soft-cascade restore in one transaction),
 * it reads the snapshot's phantom, and the restored mirror's own convergence
 * hop is deduplicated away: that observer stays stale until observer_reconcile
 * (measured 2026-10-01; WC-2026-09-30-record-write-obligation-ledger, stated limits).
 *
 * FAILURE. A drain never rethrows and never drops silently: propagation counts
 * its own failures (`observers_propagation_failed`), the drain counts anything
 * that escapes it, and `scripts/observer_reconcile.ts` repairs a stale mirror.
 * A committed write is never undone because a DERIVED recompute failed.
 *
 * Dynamic imports only toward section/record/ (import_scc_tripwire): this module
 * is loaded by the chokepoint every write goes through.
