/**
 * Shared SSRF guard for OUTBOUND-to-internet fetches (SSRF-01/SSRF-02,
 * 2026-07-28 audit; PHP `is_safe_remote_url`).
 *
 * The previous per-tool guards were STRING BLOCKLISTS ("host !== '127.0.0.1'
 * && !/^10\./…"), trivially bypassed by `[::1]`, `127.0.0.2`, `0.0.0.0`,
 * decimal/octal IP literals, IPv4-mapped IPv6, or ANY DNS name pointing at an
 * internal address. This guard instead:
 *   1. requires http/https;
 *   2. RESOLVES the hostname (so a public name pointing at 169.254.169.254 or
 *      127.0.0.1 is caught);
 *   3. vets EVERY resolved address — and an IP literal host — against the full
 *      private / loopback / link-local / reserved range set (v4 and v6), on the
 *      PACKED bytes (ip_address.ts), so no spelling of an address differs from
 *      another.
 *
 * DNS REBINDING (a hostile resolver answering "public" to the check and
 * "127.0.0.1" to the socket) is closed by PINNING the socket to the vetted
 * address: `pinToVettedAddress`, used by `fetchPinnedHop` here — and so by
 * `fetchGuardedText`, which is that hop used once (SURF-2, 2026-09-30) — and by the
 * external-services door (src/external/transport.ts). Every public-destination
 * door connects to the address it vetted; none resolves the name a second time.
 * REDIRECTS are never followed by this module: `fetchGuardedText` refuses them,
 * and `fetchPinnedHop` hands the `Location` back to its caller, which must vet
 * the next hop as a NEW target (core/harvest/ does exactly that, hop by hop).
 *
 * "WHICH IPv4 DOES THIS ADDRESS REACH" has ONE owner, this module: the verdict
 * reads the authoritative carriers, and `claimedIpv4s` answers for every carrier
 * (tighten-only) so a caller with its own policy needs no carrier table of its own.
 * The on-premise transcriber (core/tools/transcription_local_asr.ts) reads it for
 * every form of its host; PENDING: it still unions a redundant copy of the
 * deprecated/local-use tables into its metadata check, and that copy is to be deleted.
