/**
 * CORS for the JSON API — the browser-side half of the ontology-master contract.
 *
 * PHP did this in `core/api/v1/json/index.php` (SEC-012) from a `DEDALO_CORS`
 * constant. The rewrite dropped it, which silently broke the one workflow that
 * needs it: the update_ontology panel fetches `get_ontology_update_info` from
 * the MASTER **in the browser**, not through the local engine, so without CORS
 * headers on the master the preflight fails and the panel dies with a network
 * error. (The reachability probe next to it is a Bun `fetch` — server-to-server,
 * no CORS involved — so the panel could show a master as "ready" and still be
 * unable to talk to it. That asymmetry is what made this hard to spot.)
 *
 * DELIBERATE DIVERGENCES FROM PHP, both narrowing:
 *
 *   * Only the ORIGIN LIST is configurable. PHP let an operator set the allowed
 *     methods and headers too, which cannot be right: they are dictated by what
 *     `data_manager.js` sends (JSON body + `X-Dedalo-Csrf-Token`), so an
 *     operator editing them can only break the feature. They are constants here.
 *   * No `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`. PHP sent it; the client calls
 *     cross-origin with `credentials: 'same-origin'`, so no cookie is ever
 *     attached to one of these requests and the header would grant nothing.
 *     Omitting it also removes the `*`-plus-credentials footgun entirely.
 *
 * A cross-origin caller is therefore ALWAYS unauthenticated: it carries no
 * session, and reaches only what the API already opens to an anonymous request.
 * Listing an origin widens who may ASK, never what they may have.
 *
 * THE PUBLIC-MASTER CASE (2026-08-08). An enumerated allowlist cannot express a
 * PUBLIC ontology master — one that serves its update manifest to any Dédalo on
 * the internet — because the set of client origins is unbounded and unknown to
 * the operator. The single entry `*` is therefore read as "any origin". It is a
 * deliberate, operator-typed opt-in, and it is safe for the same structural
 * reason the whole feature is: the session cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, so it never
 * rides a cross-site POST no matter what the calling page asks for, and no
 * `Allow-Credentials` is ever sent. `*` widens the anonymous API surface from
 * "any HTTP client" (already true — CORS is a browser rule, not a firewall) to
 * "any HTTP client, plus any web page in a visitor's browser". What it does NOT
 * do is expose one byte of authenticated data.

 * the list, it is not allowed.
 *
 * `null` is the origin of a sandboxed iframe or a `file://` document, and
 * arrives as the LITERAL STRING "null". Under an enumerated list it can only
 * match if an operator typed it verbatim, which the doc tells them not to do.
 * Under `*` it matches like anything else — "any origin except that one" would
 * be an arbitrary carve-out that buys nothing: a page served from an origin the
 * attacker controls is already allowed.
