/**
 * THE GLOBAL-ADMIN SESSION GATE for routes that live OUTSIDE the RQO dispatcher.
 *
 * Two raw HTTP routes are admin-only and never pass `dispatchRqo`: the hierarchy dump
 * download (`server.ts` serveHierarchyExportFile) and `/api/v1/counters`
 * (`api/counters.ts`). Until 2026-09-03 both read `session.isGlobalAdmin` — the flag
 * STAMPED ON THE SESSION ROW AT LOGIN — so a demoted administrator kept both surfaces
 * for the rest of the session's life (SEC-14). The revocation seam ends the session on
 * a dd244 write it SEES (revocation.ts), but that is a belt, not the authority: a write
 * the seam never saw (a suppressed scope, another process, a failed best-effort
 * revocation) left the login-time snapshot deciding for the whole TTL.
 *
 * This module is the ONE place a non-dispatch route asks "is the caller, RIGHT NOW, a
 * global admin". It answers the way the dispatcher does for every API action
 * (`dispatch.ts` seeds `context.principal = await resolvePrincipal(session.userId)`
 * per request): the session row proves WHO is calling, the Principal — resolved from
 * the dd128 record on every request, through the cache the dd128 write reaction
 * drops — proves WHAT they are. `Session.isGlobalAdmin` is not an authorization input
 * anywhere any more (session_store.ts docblock).
 *
 * Gate: test/unit/account_revocation_native.test.ts ("the principal, not the
 * snapshot, decides" legs — a dd244 flip applied with the seam suppressed, so the
 * session SURVIVES, closes / opens both routes on the very next request).
