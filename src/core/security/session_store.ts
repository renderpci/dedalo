/**
 * Session store + login throttle — NEW NATIVE TS AUTH (spec §7.2; explicitly
 * NOT PHP-session-compatible, per project decision).
 *
 * Storage: bun:sqlite database in the private config dir. Deliberate choice:
 * - the shared PostgreSQL schema must stay untouched (spec §2.2) — TS-only
 *   infrastructure lives outside it;
 * - bun:sqlite is built-in, zero-dep, transactional, survives restarts.
 *
 * Security properties (each mirrors or exceeds a PHP guarantee):
 * - session tokens: 32 random bytes; the DB stores only their SHA-256 —
 *   a leaked DB file cannot be replayed as a cookie;
 * - session fixation resistance: tokens are server-minted (never client-set) and
 *   there are no pre-auth/anonymous sessions to fixate, so login issuing a fresh
 *   token cannot be pinned by an attacker. AUTHZ-04: concurrent multi-device
 *   sessions are allowed BY DEFAULT — `login` does not evict a user's other
 *   sessions, so a stolen token survives an ordinary re-login until its TTL. The
 *   opt-in `DEDALO_SINGLE_SESSION` flag closes that window (login calls
 *   `destroyUserSessions(userId, newToken)` — one active session per user). A
 *   password reset revokes ALL of a user's sessions regardless of the flag
 *   (password_reset.ts), so account recovery always cuts off a stolen token.
 * - per-session CSRF token (PHP SEC-008), constant-time compared;
 * - sliding-window login throttle keyed namespace|username|ip (PHP SEC-019),
 *   reset on success, shared across processes via the same sqlite file;
 * - sessions expire after SESSION_TTL_SECONDS of inactivity, and unconditionally
 *   at SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TTL_SECONDS since creation. Both clocks are enforced on
 *   read (getSession) AND swept by the GC (pruneExpiredSessions) — a session the
 *   reader rejects but the GC keeps is a row that never dies.

 *     to the entire digitised archive, permanently, and nothing is left to name it: the
 *     row that held the key is gone. That was the shipped shape, on every path.
 *   unlink-then-delete — a crash in between leaves a session that STILL WORKS. The next
 *     request, the next logout or the periodic sweep ends it properly, and in the
 *     meantime the account holds exactly the access it already had.
 *
 * So the marker goes first. The DELETE then addresses the rows BY TOKEN HASH — the same
 * rows the SELECT read — rather than re-running the predicate, so a session that was
 * touched between the two statements cannot escape the delete after its marker is
 * already gone (that would be a live row with a dead credential, and nothing to fix it
 * but a re-login).
 *
 * `dropAuthMarker` is a STATIC import, not a registered hook. The hook shape was tried
 * first and it is vacuous exactly where it matters: any process that expires a session
 * without having imported the registering module revokes nothing and only logs about
 * it. `media/protection.ts` imports config, env, server_state and svg_safety — none of
 * which reaches back here — so the static edge closes no cycle, and it makes the unlink
