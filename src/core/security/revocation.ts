/**
 * THE REVOCATION SEAM — ending an account's access, once, after a COMMIT.
 *
 * Three stores hold a live credential for one account, and until 2026-08-28 they were
 * revoked separately, or not at all:
 *
 *   1. the SESSIONS table — the token the browser replays;
 *   2. the MEDIA MARKER set — a zero-byte file the WEB SERVER stat()s. No engine
 *      process is in the media byte path, so unlinking that marker is the ONLY thing
 *      that can take the `dedalo_media_auth` cookie away; a session ended without its
 *      marker leaves the cookie reading the entire digitised archive;
 *   3. the PENDING RECOVERY CODES — a code in flight rewrites the password on
 *      possession of a mailbox alone, so it outlived every transition meant to stop it.
 *
 * This module owns all three, and it is DELIBERATELY NOT `session_media.ts`: that
 * module is the session↔marker projection (a mechanism), while this one is the
 * authorization event (a policy). Splitting them is also what keeps the import graph
 * acyclic — `permissions.ts` may statically import THIS, and this may lazily reach back
 * into `permissions.ts` for the cache clears, with no static cycle.
 *
 * ── THE LANE (2026-08-28, reviewer must-fix 1) ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A revocation is DESTRUCTIVE and NON-IDEMPOTENT-IN-INTENT: it deletes session rows,
 * unlinks filesystem markers and burns recovery codes. It therefore rides
 * `registerCommitAction` (postgres.ts) — the COMMIT-ONLY lane — and never
 * `deferPostTransaction`, whose documented contract is idempotent cache invalidation
 * and which replays on ROLLBACK too. The first shape of this seam hung off the cache
 * clear and inherited its lane: a save that ROLLED BACK still logged every session of
 * the account out, so an admin whose password edit FAILED had destroyed the target's
 * sessions anyway, and the audit trail said an edit happened that did not. The observer
 * cascade moved to `registerCommitAction` for exactly this reason (W12).
 *
 * When no transaction is ambient, `registerCommitAction` returns false and the caller
 * owns the action — it runs inline, which is correct: the write already landed and
 * there is nothing left to roll back.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER (reviewer must-fix 2) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every deletion path is MARKER FIRST, ROW SECOND, and that order is enforced one level
 * down, inside `session_store.ts`, so no caller can get it wrong. Reversing it matters
 * because the two stores fail in opposite directions: delete-then-unlink means a crash
 * in between leaves NO session row and a LIVE marker — and the web server never consults
 * the session store, so that cookie keeps read access to the whole digitised archive,
 * permanently, with nothing left to name it. Unlink-then-delete means a crash leaves a
 * session that still works, which the next request, the next logout or the periodic
 * sweep ends properly.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ALREADY IN FLIGHT (reviewer must-fix 8) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A request that is already PAST the dispatch boundary COMPLETES WITH THE AUTHORITY IT
 * RESOLVED THERE. This is ACCEPTED, deliberately: the principal and the session flags
 * are read once per request (request_context.ts) so one request cannot see two different
 * answers to "who is this" halfway through a save; re-checking mid-request would mean a
 * transaction that authorized a write at statement 3 and refused it at statement 7,
 * leaving a half-written record. The window is ONE REQUEST long — the next request
 * presents a token whose row is gone and is refused at the door, and the media cookie is
 * already dead because its marker was unlinked before the row.
 *
 * A LONG-RUNNING BACKGROUND JOB IS THE SAME ANSWER WITH A LONGER WINDOW, and it is the
 * honest residual. A detached tool run (tool_propagate_component_data, the importers, a
 * diffusion job) carries the Principal it was launched with for its whole life; revoking
 * its owner mid-run does not stop it, and nothing in this seam pretends otherwise. What
 * DOES stop it is the cooperative cancel every backgroundRunnable action already honours
 * (`ctx.signal`, driven by dd_utils_api::stop_process from the processes panel). So the
 * operator procedure for a compromised account is TWO steps — deactivate the account,
 * then stop that account's running jobs — and it is written down here and in
 * `engineering/wire_contract/WC-2026-08-28-login-active-account.md` rather than left to
 * be discovered.
 *
 * Gates: test/unit/account_revocation_native.test.ts (transitions × survivals, the lane,
 * the order), test/unit/dd128_write_census_tripwire.test.ts (the REACH census: every
 * record-write door either reaches this seam or carries an enumerated PENDING row).

 *  dd131 Active account   — the operator's only non-destructive revocation.
 *  dd132 Username         — the session row carries the username; a rename is a new
 *                           identity, and the old sessions still speak the old one.
 *  dd133 Password         — "this account is compromised, change its password" is the
 *                           standard operator reflex, and it revoked NOTHING.
 *  dd244 Security admin   — the ONLY authority a session SNAPSHOTS (session row
 *                           `is_global_admin`, read by two live routes: the thesaurus
 *                           dump download and /api/v1/counters). Nothing rewrites that
 *                           column, so a demotion cannot reach those routes any other

 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT HERE — dd1725 (profile), dd515 (developer flag) and dd170
 * (projects). Those are re-resolved per request through `resolvePrincipal` /
 * `getPermissionsTable`, whose caches the same reaction drops, so the change takes
 * effect on the next request without logging the person out mid-edit. Only dd244 is
 * snapshotted, so only dd244 needs the session to end. Ending sessions for the other
 * three would be a mass logout every time an administrator adjusts a project
 * assignment — a real harm bought for no revocation.
 *
 * VALUE-BLIND, on purpose: the seam is reached with the coordinates of the write, never
 * its value. So ANY dd131 write revokes, including a flip back to Yes. A redundant
 * revocation costs a re-login; a missed one leaves a live attacker.
