/**
 * Per-record authorization scope (PHP assert_record_in_user_scope).
 *
 * The projects filter (component_filter_master / dd170) is a WRITE boundary as
 * well as a read boundary in Dédalo: a user who can edit a section may only
 * touch the records inside their authorized projects. Read paths get this for
 * free (readSection applies the projects filter), but the write handlers (save,
 * delete, duplicate) and the tool record gate must assert it EXPLICITLY on the
 * target section_id — otherwise a level-2 user can mutate a record they can
 * never see (a direct-object-reference / tenant-isolation break).
 *
 * This is the single implementation of that check, reused everywhere so the
 * write scope rule stays byte-identical to list/search enforcement: it runs a
 * PRINCIPAL-SCOPED existence search for the record's locator (buildSearchSql
 * applies the same projects filter as any list) and reports whether the record
 * is visible. Global admins are unscoped and must be short-circuited by the
 * CALLER (they never reach here in the write handlers) — this function makes no
 * admin exception itself so it always answers the literal question "is this
 * record inside the projects filter?".
 *
 * NO SECTION IS SPECIAL-CASED HERE, and none may be. A rule that binds a
 * section (the USERS section's own-record/created_by/shared-projects rule is the
 * one that tempted it) belongs in the ASSEMBLER, where the list, the count, the
 * UNION branches and this existence probe all inherit it at once; a copy here
 * would be an ACL that answers one thing per record and another per list — the
 * exact shape of the oracle bug WC-2026-08-09-users-section-record-scope
 * records. This module therefore contains NO section tipo comparison at all.
 * Gated behaviourally by test/unit/oh1_permissions_native.test.ts "the
 * per-record answer EQUALS the list answer, record by record".

 * as `if (!principal.isGlobalAdmin) { isRecordInScope(...) }`. That inlines the admin
 * bypass ABOVE the non-positive-id refusal, so for an admin-flagged principal the
 * refusal never executed at all — and `root_user_hidden_tripwire` asserted the property
 * of the FUNCTION while every DOOR skipped it. Root (dd128/-1) is a strictly higher tier
 * than global admin everywhere else in the codebase, and its password was rewritable by
 * any global admin holding a level-2 grant on `(dd128, dd133)`.
 *
 * Calling this instead makes the order un-inlineable: the non-positive-id refusal is
 * inside the same function as the bypass, ahead of it, exactly as
 * `principalCanAccessRecord` has always had it.
 *
 * ONE LEGITIMATE FLOW WRITES A NON-POSITIVE RECORD ID, AND EXACTLY ONE — MEASURED, not
 * assumed. Every `matrix*` table carrying a `section_id` was counted read-only on
 * 2026-08-28 across the suite database and the live installation `dedalo_v7_mht`: the
 * ONLY row with `section_id < 1` anywhere is `matrix_users` dd128/-1, root itself. And
 * by construction: root is seeded by the install SQL
 * (`install/db/dedalo_install.pgsql.gz`, one COPY row), not through the API;
 * `createSectionRecord` allocates from the section counter and can only return a
 * positive id; both delete engines already refuse `sectionId < 1` themselves
 * (`delete_record.ts:73` and `:544`); the fixtures and the test corpus insert through
 * `insertMatrixRecordWithCounter`, positive by construction.
 *
 * That one flow is ROOT EDITING ITS OWN ACCOUNT — `selfServiceAccountWrite`, below. The
 * first shape of this gate had no exception, and the side effect nobody chose was that
 * root could no longer change its own password or its own email through the engine
 * either, while `password_reset.ts` excludes root from the emailed recovery flow by the
 * same `id > 0` rule: an installation with no in-engine way to rotate its most
 * privileged credential.
