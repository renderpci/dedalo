/**
 * UI-label catalogs — the repo-owned label dictionaries (WC-033). Since the
 * 2026-07-16 label-model migration these files are the SINGLE source of truth
 * for program strings: dd_ontology rows with model='label' (the dd383
 * children) are INERT for the TS engine, and labels ride code deploys — not
 * ontology updates — so a key and the code referencing it always ship in the
 * same commit (rewrite/LABELS_RECONCILE.md records the one-time DB↔file merge).
 *
 * TWO ROLES, deliberately separated (they were one file at first — WC-033
 * amendment, same day):
 *
 *  - ../labels/master.json — the SOURCE OF DEFINITIONS: the complete key set,
 *    each with its source string. This is a ROLE, not a language preference:
 *    the master happens to be authored in MASTER_SOURCE_LANG (a fact about
 *    who writes the strings, gettext-msgid style).
 *  - ./catalog/lg-<code>.json — per-lang TRANSLATIONS of the master. All
 *    langs equal; sparse allowed (missing keys resolve via the chain below).
 *    EVERY application lang has a catalog file, including the master-source
 *    lang: its file is a sparse OVERRIDE (curated display text where it
 *    should differ from the master's source string) that starts empty — the
 *    master remains its baseline, so nothing is ever duplicated.
 *
 * Serving contract (wire shape unchanged): get_environment's `get_label` is
 * the merged dictionary for the requested application lang, ALWAYS the full
 * master key set. Fallback criteria, in order (later overlays win; no
 * hardcoded language priority):
 *
 *  1. master.json — the guaranteed-complete base (labels_tripwire);
 *  2. the INSTALL's default application lang (DEDALO_APPLICATION_LANGS_DEFAULT
 *     — the operator's choice, not the engine's);
 *  3. a declared LINGUISTIC alias (LANG_ALIAS, e.g. lg-vlca reads lg-cat —
 *     language proximity, preserving the aliasing PHP baked into its
 *     generated vlca file);
 *  4. the requested lang's own catalog.
 *
 * A missing per-lang catalog is normal (the chain serves); a missing or
 * malformed MASTER throws loudly — that is a broken deploy.
