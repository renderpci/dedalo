/**
 * component_external VALUE DERIVATION — the one place a component_external's
 * strings come from, shared by the emit hook (emit.ts) and the flat-value path
 * (resolve/relation_list.ts, family 'external').
 *
 * THE MODEL. There is no stored value. A component_external's record IS the
 * remote record: the host row's `section_id` is the remote id (a zero-padded
 * STRING like '001338683' — never Number()'d, that drops the padding and asks
 * the service for a different record), the host section's ontology
 * `properties.api_config` says which service and where, and the COMPONENT's own
 * `properties.fields_map` says which remote fields become this component's
 * entries. All three are read here; the network is entirely
 * src/external/'s business, reached through its facade.
 *
 * NO SILENT BLANKS — the rule this module exists to keep. Every path that
 * cannot produce values says WHY, in a `source_status` block the client can
 * render. The failure modes are a matter of fact (the service is down, the
 * record was deleted upstream, the operator has not allowlisted the host), and
 * a cataloguer looking at an empty field must be able to tell them apart from
 * "this record genuinely has no author". v6 emitted nothing at all in every one
 * of these cases.
 *
 * WHY THE FACADE IS A DYNAMIC IMPORT (engineering/CONVENTIONS.md): `src/core`
 * and `src/external` are peers, and a STATIC value edge from core into the
 * external subsystem would fuse them into one import component — the S2-20
 * defect class. The type import is static (erased, and the SCC gate excludes
 * `import type`); the value import is lazy, so a core module that never touches
 * an external section never loads the subsystem at all.
