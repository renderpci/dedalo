/**
 * RETENTION REGISTRY — the ONE place that says, for every APPEND-ONLY store the
 * engine writes, how long its rows are kept and how an operator removes them
 * (audit 2026-08-26 P2-9; SEC-20, SEC-21, PUB-14).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The engine already pruned some of its stores and not
 * others, with no way to tell which was which: terminal diffusion jobs at 7
 * days, media process files at 30, error reports at 90 — while `matrix_activity`
 * (one row per state-changing action, one per DENIED LOGIN) and the `dd1758`
 * publication ledger (one row per record per publish run — measured 293 MB for
 * a single 500k-record run) had ZERO prune code anywhere in `src/`, `tools/` or
 * `scripts/`. The job purge even justified itself by pointing at the dd1758
 * ledger as "the durable audit trail", so the one store expected to hold history
 * was the one store with no policy for it. All of it sits inside the database
 * `pg_dump` copies on every backup, which is how unbounded growth becomes a
 * RECOVERY defect before it is a disk defect.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. One `RetentionDefinition` per store. Each declares the modules
 * that INSERT into it (`writers` — what the census gate maps its scan hits
 * through) and exactly ONE of two policies:
 *
 *   - `window`  — a configured number of days plus an EXECUTABLE `prune`. The
 *                 engine can run it: `runRetention(name, {apply:true})`, the
 *                 scheduler, or `scripts/`-level callers.
 *   - `forever` — kept permanently, with a REASON. Legitimate for the heritage
 *                 record itself; never legitimate as a default nobody chose.
 *
 * A window whose configured value is 0 keeps rows until an operator sets a
 * window — the difference from before is that the door EXISTS and is named, and
 * a museum can open it without a DBA writing DELETE statements by hand.
 *
 * SHRINK-ONLY: `REGISTERED_NAMES` is the closed set; `registerRetention` refuses
 * a name outside it, so a new append-only store is a deliberate edit here and in
 * the catalog (prune.ts), never a drive-by INSERT.
