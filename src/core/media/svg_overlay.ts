/**
 * IMAGE SVG OVERLAY — the edit-view display envelope (PHP component_image
 * create_default_svg_string_node / get_svg_file_path / get_base_svg_url).
 *
 * The client's image EDIT view does not point an <img> at the raster directly —
 * it loads an `<object type="image/svg+xml" data="{base_svg_url}">`, an SVG
 * envelope that embeds the raster via `<image xlink:href="{quality url}">` and
 * anchors the vector annotation layers ("Capas de dibujo"). When the read omits
 * `base_svg_url` (no envelope on disk) the client falls back to the placeholder
 * SVG and shows nothing. So every uploaded/regenerated image MUST also get its
 * SVG envelope, and the read MUST emit its URL.
 *
 * The envelope lives in a literal `svg` sub-folder of the image tree:
 *   MEDIA_PATH + /image + initial_media_path + /svg + additional_path + /<id>.svg
