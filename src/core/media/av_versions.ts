/**
 * AV DERIVATIVE ENCODER — the ONE place an av quality tier is produced.
 *
 * Two callers, one encoder:
 *  - INGEST (`ingest/process_uploaded_file.ts` → submitAvTranscode): after an
 *    upload, build the default quality + the audio tier.
 *  - THE TOOL (`tools/versions.ts` → build_version, the media-versions panel's
 *    gear): build the ONE quality tier the operator asked for.
 *
 * The tool path used to call `submitAvTranscode` directly, which knows only the
 * default quality — so a click on 1080/720/576/240 re-encoded 404 instead, the
 * requested tier never appeared on disk, and the panel blinked "Processing"
 * forever polling for a file nobody was building. PHP built `$quality`
 * (component_av::build_version → Ffmpeg::get_setting_name($source, $quality)).
 *
 * Source resolution is PHP's (component_av::build_version :1470): the ORIGINAL,
 * falling back to the default-quality file when the box has no original. A tier
 * is never built from itself.
