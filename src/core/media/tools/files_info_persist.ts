/**
 * files_info write-back (Media R1 tail). After a mutating media op
 * (build_version / rotate / delete_version), refresh the stored media item's
 * files_info in the matrix so the DB is immediately consistent instead of waiting
 * for the next component save.
 *
 * THE ONE MEDIA-KEY WRITER (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2: TOOLS-5,
 * WC-2026-09-30-media-key-locked-transform). Every write of a `media[tipo]` array
 * outside the component save is a LOCKED TRANSFORM (transformStoredMediaItems):
 * the stored items are read under the row's `FOR UPDATE` lock and the caller's
 * pure function decides, from THOSE items, what to write. A door that did its
 * file work first and then wrote the array it had read before (tool_update_cache,
 * the files_info reconcile sweep, the duplicate's media refresh) silently
 * reverted anything a curator committed in between — an upload's name keys, a
 * second item. The private `writeItems` has exactly one caller, the transform
 * (write_obligations_tripwire leg B4).
 *
 * This is a METADATA refresh (files_info reflects the filesystem, not user data),
 * so it uses the per-key jsonb write (updateMatrixKeyData) WITHOUT a Time Machine
 * entry — PHP re-derives files_info by scanning on every read/save, so the stored
 * copy is a cache, not authoritative history. The live-scanned value the tools
 * already return to the client is unchanged; this only keeps the stored cache in
 * step. `persistScannedFilesInfo` never creates items — a component with no
 * stored media item is left untouched (nothing to refresh). Minting one is the
 * job of `persistUploadedMedia` below, reached only from an INGEST or the
 * operator's explicit sync_files reconcile; a passive scan must never do it.
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION, and it is NOT metadata: when the DELETE that emptied the record
 * takes its LAST media file, the same locked write clears the drawing that
 * belonged to that picture (`lib_data` → null, `svg_file_data` dropped) and
 * appends the cleared value to the Time Machine in the same transaction. The
 * layers are scholarship, not a cache — hence the audit row. See
 * `reconcileStoredFilesInfo` options and the SVG-envelope lifecycle policy in
 * engineering/MEDIA_SPEC.md.
