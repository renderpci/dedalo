/**
 * MEDIA PROCESSING — derivative generation (PHP build_version / regenerate_component).
 *
 * Given an ORIGINAL file, build the default-quality derivative, the thumbnail,
 * and any alternate-extension versions, per type. Uses the binary adapters
 * (imagemagick/ffmpeg/pdf) over the spawn discipline. Every output goes through
 * `./atomic.ts` (temp sibling + rename + debris sweep), so a coexisting reader
 * never sees a partial derivative and a failed run leaves nothing behind
 * (Original law: the original is the source of truth and is never mutated).
 *
 * SCENE SELECTION (2026-08-04): a source can hold N images (Photoshop layers,
 * TIFF/PDF pages, GIF frames). Each recipe here PROBES its source once
 * (`./engine/probe.ts`) and hands the argv layer an explicit scene selection, a
 * flatten background and the CMYK flag. Before that, a layered TIFF made
 * ImageMagick write `<stem>-0.jpg`… instead of the temp, the rename threw ENOENT
 * and the record was left with `matrix.media` NULL.
 *
 * PHP anchors: build_version (:3543), regenerate_component (:3153),
 * component_image build_version (:1461), component_pdf create_alternative_version
 * (:1375), component_av build_version (:1437, async transcode via jobs).

 * it renders the image opaque. On the 2026-08-04 medal masters scene 0's meta
 * channel IS the medal silhouette; unapplied, the retouch paint that sits outside
 * the silhouette survives into every tier (the reported blue blobs). Applied, the
 * derivative is cut at the edge of the medal, which is what the master says.
 *
 * THIS IS AN INFERENCE, NOT A FACT THE FILE STATES. `tiffinfo` on those very
 * masters prints `Extra Samples: 1<unspecified>`: the format declares the plane
 * has NO declared meaning. (When a TIFF does declare an extra sample to be alpha —
 * ExtraSamples 1 or 2 — ImageMagick promotes it to a real alpha plane itself and
 * no meta channel is reported, so a meta channel is by construction always an
 * `unspecified` one.) Photoshop puts other things there, and the rules below plus
 * the post-condition in `writeGuardedAgainstABlankingMask` are what keep a wrong
 * guess from destroying a record. Every refusal is LOUD.
 *
 * THE RULES, each with the measurement that forces it:
 *
 *  - NEVER ON 'composite'. `-channel-fx` COLLAPSES the image list to image 0.
 *    Measured: a 2-scene source (layer 0 red, layer 1 green, both `srgb 4.1`)
 *    flattened WITHOUT the fx gives p(50,50) = srgb(0,128,1), the composited
 *    stack; WITH the fx it gives srgb(254,0,0) — layer 1 silently discarded,
 *    exit 0, one file, and the `-flatten` that follows has nothing left to
 *    composite. The composite selection exists precisely to keep the stack, so the
 *    two are mutually exclusive. v6 agreed: `class.ImageMagick.php:276-281` sets
 *    `$composite = false; $flatten = false;` in this branch.
 *  - EXACTLY ONE META CHANNEL. With two (`srgb 5.2`) `meta0` is whichever plane
 *    the producing application happened to write first. Measured on a master whose
 *    meta0 is a spot-ink plate and whose meta1 is the real silhouette: promoting
 *    meta0 yields a COMPLETELY BLANK white derivative (std 0, mean 1), and simply
 *    reversing the channel order renders correctly. The engine cannot inspect that
 *    order, so a multi-meta source is unknowable and must fall through unmasked.
 *    v6 said the same in a comment ("multiple meta channels are not supported")
 *    but never checked; this refuses, and says so.
 *  - TRUE ALPHA WINS. When image 0 carries a real alpha plane AND a meta channel,
 *    do not apply the fx: it OVERWRITES the alpha plane, so v6's rule would
 *    destroy real transparency with whatever selection a retoucher had saved. The
 *    alpha plane is the unambiguous carrier; the meta channel is only a stand-in
 *    for a source that has none.
 *  - ONLY FOR CONTAINERS THAT CAN CARRY ONE, so the expensive count is never asked
 *    for a JPEG/PNG/GIF. See `probeMetaChannels` for what asking costs.
 *
 * EXPORTED FOR ITS GATE. The 'composite' rule cannot be reached end-to-end with the
 * containers ImageMagick can WRITE on this box — a TIFF does not round-trip page
 * offsets (so its scene 0 is always full-frame and the probe never selects
 * composite) and IM's PSD writer drops meta channels — so the rule is gated here,
 * on the function that owns it, plus a companion gate that reproduces the damage it
 * prevents. A real Photoshop-authored PSD is not bound by IM's writer limits, which
 * is exactly why the rule is not left to chance.

 *
 *   - an EMPTY extra sample (a channel Photoshop initialised to black, never

 * Without this guard each of those silently replaces a record's default tier, its
 * thumb and its SVG envelope with a blank the moment tool_update_cache sweeps the
 * archive, and nothing anywhere says so. That is the worst failure a heritage
 * engine can have, so the promotion is verified rather than trusted.
 *
 * The fallback is not a failure path: rebuilding WITHOUT the mask yields exactly
 * what this engine shipped before the promotion existed, and exactly what v6
 * shipped for jpg tiers. A genuinely blank master stays blank either way, so the
 * check cannot invent damage — it can only decline to cause it.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, KNOWN-OPEN: this catches a mask that destroys the WHOLE picture, not

 * a non-uniform derivative and passes here. Detecting that needs a judgement about

 * nothing could produce, and the one twin class that did exist (v6-migrated)
 * silently depicted a superseded master.
 *
 * A TWIN IS A PER-TIER COMPANION of that tier's normalized file — same picture,
 * same tier, other container. The invariant, stated in the direction the engine
 * can actually hold at ALL times:
 *
 *     exists(Q/<id>.<E>)  ⇒  exists(Q/<id>.<defaultExtension>)   for every derived Q
 *
 * NO TWIN WITHOUT ITS COMPANION, EVER — enforced here (absent tier file → any
 * twin found is RETIRED to deleted/) and, just as importantly, on the paths that
 * REMOVE a companion rather than build one (`retireOrphanTwins`, called from the
 * delete seam: a delete changes no master, so nothing here would have run).
 *
 * The converse is a RECONCILIATION, not a disk state: with the tier's own file
 * present the twin is (re)built FROM THE MASTER here, but it may legitimately be
 * absent in between — the key can be empty, the format may not be encodable on
 * this host, an operator may have deleted that one file, or the tier may carry a
 * rotation the master does not (see companionDisagreesWithMaster). Every one of
 * those is a case the engine reports rather than a state it silently fixes.
 *
 * THE SOURCE IS THE MASTER, NEVER THE TIER'S SIBLING JPG. Transcoding the jpg
 * would be cheaper and is WRONG: that file has already been composited onto white
 * by `backgroundForTarget`, so the alpha the twin exists to carry is gone before
 * the transcode starts. MEASURED on the layered medal master through this exact
 * recipe — from the MASTER the avif comes out `srgba`, `opaque=False`, PSNR 44.56
 * against the master; from the tier's jpg it comes out `opaque=True`, PSNR 3.31,
 * the cut-out destroyed. Building from the jpg would produce a file that passes
 * every existence check and depicts the wrong thing, which is the defect class
 * this whole subsystem exists to end.
 *
 * `mode`:
 *  - 'reconcile' (a master changed) — build, replace and retire to restore the
 *    invariant;
 *  - 'missing-only' (repair) — build ONLY absent twins, never retire anything.
 *    That is repair's contract: it fixes what is missing and never re-encodes or
 *    removes what an operator may have authored. A STALE twin is therefore NOT
 *    repaired here (it is corrected by the next master change) — stated, not
 *    narrowed: the engine cannot tell a stale twin from an operator-authored one
 *    without per-tier provenance, which is the ledgered gap.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS for a per-file failure. A host with no AVIF delegate must be left
 * honestly twin-LESS rather than stale, which is exactly what the retire branch
 * gives it — today's behaviour, now gated. The failures travel in `errors`, each
 * naming `spec.alternateExtensionsConfigKey`, so an operator reads WHICH key
 * asked for a format this box cannot write.

 * previous one would keep serving the previous picture forever, with a
 * files_info that reports it as present and current. An absent tier is still NOT
 * created here: tiers are minted on demand by tool_media_versions, and building
 * a 100MB derivative nobody asked for on every upload is a different decision
 * than keeping an existing one honest.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS, AND WHY IT IS RECOVERABLE. A derived tier is not necessarily
 * machine-authored: tool_image_rotation rotates and crops the DERIVED tiers in
 * place, and an operator can park a curated file in any tier by uploading into
 * it. Re-encoding replaces that work. Measured before this pass: a hand-placed
 * blue '6MB' came back green (the new master) with no trace. So every file this
 * loop replaces goes to `deleted/` FIRST (renameOldFiles — the engine's
 * No-hard-delete law, PHP rename_old_files :1193) and the replacement is named
 * in a console.warn. The tiers stay honest AND the operator's bytes survive.
 *
 * The DEFAULT tier and the thumb above are deliberately NOT backed up: they have
 * been rebuilt unconditionally on every master ingest since long before this
 * change, and turning every upload on the install into deleted/ churn is a
 * different decision from making a newly-destructive loop recoverable. That
 * asymmetry is the honest state, not an oversight — see the report gap on
 * per-tier provenance, which is what would let the engine tell "machine-built"
 * from "operator-authored" and stop guessing.
 *
 * IT RETURNS A RESULT OBJECT, NOT A PATH LIST (2026-08-07). The alternate twins
 * are built here, and a twin failure is NON-FATAL by construction (a box with no
 * AVIF delegate must still get its jpg ladder). With a `string[]` return that
 * failure had nowhere to go: `derivativeErrors` was populated at exactly ONE
 * site — the ingest catch — so a host that cannot write the configured format
 * would have reported every upload as a complete success while the format was
 * silently not produced. That is the defect this whole change exists to end, so
 * the channel is part of the signature.

 * whole regeneration as failed would hide a record whose deliverable file is
 * perfectly in place. The failure travels as a VALUE so the caller can put it in
