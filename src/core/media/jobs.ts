/**
 * MEDIA JOB MANAGER — supervised async jobs with a client-compatible poll wire.
 *
 * PHP ran long media conversions as detached `nohup`/`sh` processes tracked in a
 * `processes` DB table + on-disk process files, and the client polled a status
 * stream. This rewrite keeps the CLIENT contract (a process file + status
 * frames `{pid, pfile, is_running, data, errors, total_time}`) but modernizes
 * the internals: in-process supervised jobs, a concurrency cap, progress ticks,
 * real cancellation, and idempotent recovery (engineering/MEDIA_SPEC.md §5.5). Jobs are
 * TS-visible only — TS never reads PHP's `processes` table or pfiles.
 *
 * Not a persistent queue: on restart, running pfiles are marked interrupted —
 * lazily on pfile-fallback read AND by the boot sweep `reconcileProcessFiles`
 * (audit S2-15/DEC-22: records stamp the owning process pid; a 'running'
 * pfile whose owner is not alive can never complete and is flipped to
 * 'interrupted' so the poll wire stops reporting a dead job as live). The
 * derivative work is safe to re-request because every derivative rebuilds from
 * the untouched original and outputs are atomic (temp+rename).
 *
 * LANES (PERF-11). There used to be ONE cap for everything: a transcode queue,
 * an ASR batch, a 10k-row import and an operator's code update all drew from the
 * same three slots, so a full ingest starved the update the operator was waiting
 * on. Work is now classed into LANES with independent budgets, and the class is
 * DECLARED at the submit site (`meta.lane`) — never inferred from the `kind`
 * string, which is how a new job silently lands in the wrong lane and the
 * starvation comes back without anyone editing a budget.
 *
 * DEADLINES. Each lane carries a default wall-clock budget (per-submit
 * override), armed from RUN START — after the slot is acquired, not from submit:
 * a job that waited behind a full lane must not be killed for having waited.
 * When it fires it aborts the job's controller (which is now also the AMBIENT
 * job signal, media/job_scope.ts, so an awaited outbound call is cancelled too)
 * with the reason `deadline` (jobAbortReason — a worker tells it from a user's
 * `stop` and a `shutdown` by jobAbortInfo) and marks the record terminal. It does NOT release the lane slot: the slot is
 * released when the worker actually settles, because releasing it while ffmpeg
 * still holds the CPU would over-subscribe the box. A worker that has not
 * settled `JOB_DEADLINE_SETTLE_GRACE_MS` after its abort bumps the
 * `job_deadline_lane_held` counter, so a wedged lane is observable rather than
 * silent.
 *
 * WHAT AN ABORT DOES NOT REACH, stated rather than discovered: child processes.
 * `Bun.spawn` sites (ffmpeg, pg_dump, the transcriber sidecar) do not subscribe
 * to the job signal — their cancellation is their own subprocess handle, and
 * wiring it is a separate change with its own gate. The deadline therefore stops
 * the JS work and frees the record; a spawned child of a deadlined job runs to
 * its own end, which is exactly what the held-lane counter above measures.

/**
 * THE WORK CLASS a job draws its slot from — its LANE.
 *
 * Five classes, because five kinds of work compete for genuinely different
 * resources and have genuinely different urgencies:
 *
 *  - `media`         ffmpeg/ImageMagick derivative building. CPU + IO heavy, and
 *                    legitimately hours long (a master transcode).
 *  - `transcription` speech-to-text batches: mostly WAITING on a sidecar, so its
 *                    slots are cheap to hold but must not eat the media budget.
 *  - `rag`           embedding/index building against the vector store.
 *  - `maintenance`   the operator's own work — code update, data update, cache
 *                    rebuild, imports, the dev long-process probe. This is the
 *                    lane the single shared cap used to starve, which is the
 *                    whole reason lanes exist.
 *  - `export`        a user's full export (tool_export `build_export_artifact`):
 *                    the record walk + spool. Long, DB- and disk-bound, started
 *                    by ANY reader of a section — which is exactly why it must
 *                    not share the operator's budget: a curator exporting 300k
 *                    records must never be able to hold up the update an
 *                    administrator is waiting on, nor the reverse.
 *  - `export_file`   a file built from a FINISHED export (tool_export
 *                    `build_export_file`: CSV/TSV/HTML/XLSX/ODS/NDJSON/media
 *                    ZIP). The delimited/HTML/spreadsheet/NDJSON formats read
 *                    only the spool, never the database, and are short next
 *                    to a walk; the media ZIP re-reads each record's access +
 *                    stored media from the database and streams every master
 *                    file, so it can run for hours with DB load on this lane.
 *                    Its own lane, not `export`'s: with one shared slot, every
 *                    user's download would queue FIFO behind another user's
 *                    multi-hour walk.
 *
 * THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `publication` LANE. Publication/diffusion work runs
 * on the DURABLE queue (src/diffusion/), which has its own depth, its own
 * dispatcher and its own budget; a lane here that no call site can reach would
 * publish a permanently-zero row on /api/v1/counters and read as coverage that
 * does not exist. If in-process publication work is ever submitted here, the
 * lane is added WITH its call site, in the same change.
