/**
 * SPAWN DISCIPLINE — the one place media binaries are executed.
 *
 * Every media transform shells out to an external binary (ImageMagick, ffmpeg,
 * pdftotext, …). PHP built shell strings and relied on escapeshellarg/cmd. This
 * rewrite uses `Bun.spawn` with ARGV ARRAYS and NO SHELL — arguments never
 * traverse a shell parser, so there is nothing to escape and injection is
 * structurally impossible (engineering/MEDIA_SPEC.md §5.3, categorically stronger than
 * PHP). No `sh -c`, no `.sh` files, no string interpolation of user values.
 *
 * `nice -n 19` is preserved (shared-host courtesy — the PHP server, the DB and
 * this process share the box). Outputs are written to a temp name and atomically
 * renamed by callers so a coexisting PHP reader never sees a partial derivative.
 *
 * INTEGRITY LAW (audit 2026-08 B2): a command that was killed — by the timeout
 * cap or by any signal — DID NOT SUCCEED. `SpawnResult.ok` is the single truth,
 * `assertSpawnOk` is the gate, and no caller may AND a timeout away to reach a
 * success path (gated in `test/unit/media_encode_integrity_native.test.ts`, and
 * widened to every media runner by invariant 7 of
 * `test/unit/media_writer_discipline_tripwire.test.ts`).
 *
 * TWO TIMEOUT POLICIES, because "long" and "hung" are different things.
 * A wall-clock budget is the right instrument for a BOUNDED command (a header
 * probe, a page count): it is expected to finish in milliseconds, so any minute
 * scale runtime is a wedge. It is the WRONG instrument for a TRANSCODE: this is
 * an oral-history archive whose masters are hour-long interviews, and how long a
 * two-pass x264 encode of one legitimately takes is a function of the source's
 * duration, the box and how many lanes are busy — no constant can separate "still
 * encoding" from "stuck". PHP capped nothing at all (it wrote a `.sh` and ran it
 * detached, class.Ffmpeg.php:786-793); making the 10-minute cap a HARD failure
 * without changing what it measures would have turned B2's silent corruption into
 * a guaranteed failure for exactly the content it was measured on.
 *
 * So a producer runs under `idleTimeoutMs`: the cap measures SILENCE, not work.
 * Every chunk on stdout or stderr re-arms it, and `engine/ffmpeg.ts` gives every
 * ffmpeg run its own `-progress pipe:1` liveness channel so a live encode is
 * never silent. An encode that emits nothing for ten minutes is wedged whatever
 * its source's duration; one that reports progress runs to completion.
