/**
 * UPLOAD RECEIVER — multipart/chunked upload staging (PHP dd_utils_api::upload
 * :925 + join_chunked_files_uploaded :1379).
 *
 * Parses the vendored client's multipart form (Content-Range / X-File-Name /
 * fields key_dir,file_name,chunked,start,end,chunk_index,total_chunks,upload_id,
 * file_to_upload), sniffs the MAGIC BYTES (never the client Content-Type),
 * cross-validates the extension, stages under the per-user upload tmp dir, and
 * on the final chunk joins + RE-VERIFIES the assembled file (SEC-066 +
 * verify_content.ts). Returns the staged tmp name once the upload is complete;
 * the caller then runs processUploadedFile to add_file + regenerate.
 *
 * Bun's native request.formData() parses the body — no third-party library.
 * Chunks are client-capped (~MB) so buffering one in memory is acceptable;
 * streaming multipart is ledgered as a later optimization.
 *
 * ── STAGED IDENTITY (WC-2026-08-03-chunked-upload-identity) ──────────────────
 * One logical upload has ONE identity, decided ONCE, and the FINAL staged name
 * is allocated ONCE at completion:
 *
 *   • every part of a transfer is written under `.up_<uploadId>/` inside the
 *     user's key_dir, so two transfers can never interleave their parts;
 *   • `uploadId` is the client's `upload_id` field when present (validated, NOT
 *     sanitized — a malformed one is refused), else a value DERIVED from the raw
 *     client file name + chunk count, which is stable across the chunks of one
 *     transfer without any client coordination;
 *   • the final name is claimed at completion with an atomic `link` and a
 *     `-1`, `-2`, … ladder, so two files whose names sanitize to the same thing
 *     (`María.jpg` and `Mar#a.jpg` → `Mar_a.jpg`) get two distinct staged files
 *     instead of one overwriting the other.
 *
 * Why not allocate per chunk: chunks arrive concurrently with no defined first
 * arrival, so an allocator that ran per chunk would scatter one transfer's parts
 * across several identities. Uniqueness has to be decided once, up front (the
 * id) or once, at the end (the name) — never in between.
 *
 * ── A REFUSED TRANSFER IS QUARANTINED, NEVER DELETED ─────────────────────────
 * Nothing on this path may destroy a completed transfer. A failed content
 * verification parks the assembled bytes in the transfer's own artifact dir with
 * a `rejected.json` marker (quarantineAssembled / listQuarantinedUploads); an
 * interrupted assembly keeps every part until the join reaches a durable outcome
 * (ASSEMBLY_STALE_MS recovery). Both release through the mechanisms that already
 * existed — the 24 h age sweep and the explicit cancel — so nothing new leaks,
 * and a curator's forty-hour upload is never destroyed by a heuristic verdict.
