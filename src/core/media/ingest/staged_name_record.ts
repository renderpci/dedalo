/**
 * THE SERVER'S RECORD OF WHAT A STAGED FILE WAS CALLED.
 *
 * A staged upload has TWO names and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   • the STAGED name — `stagedTmpName` + `claimStagedName`: sanitized down to
 *     `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]` and collision-suffixed, because it becomes a filesystem
 *     segment. Lossy and not injective by construction.
 *   • the DISPLAY name — `displayFileName`: 'María Piñón.jpg', defanged but never
 *     transliterated, because it is PROVENANCE. It is the only surviving record
 *     of what the curator delivered, since the file itself is renamed to a
 *     deterministic identifier the moment it is ingested.
 *
 * The receiver knows both. The INGEST, which runs in a later request (the client
 * posts the bytes, then calls `tool_upload::process_uploaded_file` /
 * `tool_import_files` / the MCP media tool), used to be handed only the staged
 * one — so the display name existed for exactly as long as the upload response,
 * and the archive recorded `Mar_a_Pi_n.jpg` (audit 2026-08 §5.2).
 *
 * Relaying it back through the client does not fix that: it makes the recorded
 * provenance re-decidable by a later request, and it only works for callers that
 * cooperate — as of 2026-08-09 none of the three ingest callers did, which is why
 * the first restoration attempt was wired at the transport and dead in
 * production. So the name is PERSISTED BESIDE THE STAGED FILE by the receiver
 * and read back by the ingest, exactly as `meta.json` already carries a chunked
 * transfer's name across its own request boundary — the law stated in
 * `WC-2026-08-03-chunked-upload-identity`: the name on disk must not be
 * re-decidable by a later request.
 *
 * SHAPE. One file per staged name under `<staging dir>/.names/<staged name>`,
 * containing the display name as UTF-8 and nothing else. A directory (not a
 * shared index) so two concurrent uploads into one key_dir never write the same
 * file; dot-prefixed so `listStagedFiles` skips it and `resolveStagedPath`
 * cannot address it (it accepts `<key_dir>[/thumbnail]/<name>` and nothing else).
 *
 * LIFECYCLE. Written at the moment the staged name is claimed (both doors:
 * single-shot and the chunked join), consumed by the ingest when the file leaves
 * staging, dropped with the file by `deleteStagedFile`, and swept by
 * `staging_gc.ts` when its file is gone and it is older than the retention
 * window. It never outlives the file it describes.
