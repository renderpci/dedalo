/**
 * MEDIA UPLOAD HTTP ENDPOINT — the multipart branch of the API path.
 *
 * Authenticates the session, enforces CSRF (upload is NOT exempt — SEC-008),
 * receives/stages the chunk(s), and returns the `file_data` descriptor the
 * client hands to tool_upload.process_uploaded_file (PHP two-call flow:
 * dd_utils_api::upload → tool_upload::process_uploaded_file). Fail-closed: no
 * session → 404 (no existence leak), bad CSRF → 403, bad file → 400.
 *
 * ENVELOPE v2 (engineering/ERRORS_SPEC.md §3-4). This route is served by
 * server.ts BEFORE the API dispatcher — it never enters the dispatch
 * chokepoint, so it owns its own Responses. It still builds them through the
 * ONE converter door (`ok` / `toErrorEnvelope`), never by hand.
 *
 * `file_data` stays a TOP-LEVEL EXTENSION KEY and `data` carries the boolean
 * outcome (PHP answered `result:true`): the upload client reads
 * `api_response.file_data` at top level and gates every part on
 * `response_data(api_response) !== true` (upload_transport.js), so `data` has
 * to BE `true` — a payload object there would fail that strict check and hang
 * every transfer.
