/**
 * MEDIA PROTECTION — Rule A (back-office auth) + the generated web-server rules.
 * Native TS port of the PHP oracle `core/media_protection/class.media_protection.php`
 * (frozen tree), which the cutover left behind: PHP minted the auth cookie, wrote the
 * `auth/` markers and generated `media/.htaccess`, and PHP is gone. Closes audit
 * MEDIA-01 / SECURITY_DECISIONS DECISION 1 option (B). Definition of the whole
 * subsystem: engineering/MEDIA_PROTECTION.md.
 *
 * ONE media tree serves two audiences at the same URLs, with no file duplication:
 *
 *  - Rule A (work system): a logged-in user carries the FIXED-NAME cookie
 *    `dedalo_media_auth`, whose daily-rotated value must exist as a zero-byte marker
 *    in <media>/.publication/auth/{value}. Grants unrestricted media access.
 *  - Rule B (publication): an anonymous user may read only files of PUBLISHED records,
 *    and only inside the configured public quality folders. The web server stats
 *    <media>/.publication/pub/{section_tipo}_{section_id}, with the record identity
 *    parsed out of the media FILE NAME. Those markers are written by the diffusion
 *    engine (diffusion/targets/mediastore/media_index.ts) — never here.
 *
 * THE WEB SERVER ENFORCES, NOT THIS PROCESS. Authorization is one stat() per request,
 * performed by Apache/nginx itself, so multi-GB files keep native sendfile/Range and
 * the H.264 / nginx-mp4 `?start=` clipping handlers. No Bun process ever sits in the
 * media-serving path — the gate can never break streaming. This module only MAINTAINS
 * the artifacts the web server reads: the auth markers and the two rule files.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, AND AS 404 — never 403: the existence of unpublished media is not
 * disclosed. Every failure path (missing marker, malformed cookie, non-grammar
 * filename) denies. Rule A markers are engine-owned and independent of publication
 * state, so a diffusion failure can never lock editors out.
 *
 * MARKER-STORE OWNERSHIP IS EXCLUSIVE. Under <media>/.publication/:
 *   auth/{cookie_value}   ← THIS module, and only this module
 *   pub/{key}, dbs/…      ← media_index.ts, and only media_index.ts
