/**
 * MEDIA REPAIR KERNEL — refresh a component's stored media items against the
 * filesystem, optionally rebuilding the derivative files first.
 *
 * `files_info` is a DISK-DERIVED CACHE the read path serves verbatim for
 * image/pdf/svg/3d (only component_av re-scans per read — component_emit.ts).
 * When it goes stale (e.g. a write that ran while MEDIA_PATH pointed at the
 * wrong tree), the record renders nothing although the files are on disk.
 * This module is the ONE copy of the fix, composed from the existing seams:
 *
 * - regenerate*  (processing.ts)  — rebuild default quality + thumb (+ image
 *   SVG envelope) from the original, where the original is on this box;
 * - refreshStoredFilesInfo (files_info.ts) — re-scan the disk and splice a
 *   fresh files_info into each stored item, preserving the sibling keys
 *   (original_* / modified_* / lib_data / external_source).
 *
 * TWO HALVES, because they belong on two sides of a row lock
 * (CLOSURE_PLAN Step 2, TOOLS-5):
 * - regenerateMediaDerivatives — the FILE work (seconds per record): outside any
 *   lock, keyed by the identities of a snapshot;
 * - rescanMediaItems — SYNCHRONOUS, a pure function of the items it is handed:
 *   it runs INSIDE files_info_persist.ts transformStoredMediaItems, on the items
 *   read under the row lock, so a value a curator committed while the files were
 *   being rebuilt is what gets refreshed — never overwritten by a snapshot.
 * refreshMediaItems composes the two for a caller that only reads (the sweep's
 * dry-run adjudication).
 *
 * Callers and their division of labor:
 * - tools/tool_update_cache (in-app, per-section, SQO-driven): regenerate, then
 *   the locked rescan with holdShrink;
 * - core/media/files_info_reconcile.ts sweepFilesInfo (scripts/
 *   media_repair_files_info.ts, the reconcile registry): no regeneration; a
 *   dry-run adjudication on the snapshot, then per change a locked rescan that
 *   re-judges GROW/DIFF/SHRINK on the locked items;
 * - section/record/duplicate_record.ts: the clone's locked rescan at its own
 *   identity.
 * PERSISTENCE IS THE TRANSFORM'S (files_info_persist.ts — NO Time Machine entry,
 * files_info is a filesystem cache): the kernel never touches the DB.

 *     quality file is absent (the builders are internally idempotent copies;
 *     they need the original).

 *     ones from the master, per derived tier that holds its own file. See the
 *     step in the body for why it is LAST and per-extension wrapped, and
 *     processing.ts buildAlternateVersions for why repair never retires or

 * and the tool already report through. A throw here would abort steps 3-5 for the
