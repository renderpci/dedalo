/**
 * Resolve the ontology-driven path options for a media component in a section:
 * `max_items_folder` (the component's own property), `initial_media_path`
 * (the SECTION's property keyed by the component tipo) and `additional_path`
 * (the component's property naming a SIBLING component whose value on THIS
 * record is the bucket folder). PHP get_additional_path (:753-819) /
 * get_initial_media_path (:715).
 *
 * ── TWO SCOPES, AND WHY THE SIGNATURE HAS AN OPTIONAL THIRD ARGUMENT ─────────
 * `initial_media_path` and `max_items_folder` are properties of the ONTOLOGY —
 * the same for every record of the section. `additional_path` is not: it names
 * another component (e.g. rsc29 → rsc33 'Directorio'), and the folder is that
 * component's VALUE ON ONE RECORD. So a media path is only fully determined once
 * the record is known.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-09 nothing resolved it at all: `MediaPathOptions.additionalPathOverride`
 * was declared and every producer left it undefined, so an install that uses the
 * property wrote and read at the numeric bucket instead of the named folder —
 * i.e. every PHP-era file of such a component was UNREACHABLE from the TS engine
 * (the `rsc165` Certificate of Cession / Questionnaire case in the 2026-08 audit).
 * Measured on this install: `rsc33` and `rsc324` hold no value on any record in
 * either database, so the property is latent here and the bucket fallback is what
 * both engines compute — which is exactly why the gap survived unnoticed.
 *
 * Call `resolveMediaPathOptions(componentTipo, sectionTipo, sectionId)` — the
 * RECORD-scoped form — from anywhere a record is in hand. The two-argument form
 * is the section-scoped one; it leaves `additionalPathOverride` UNDEFINED (never
 * a fabricated null), and the call sites still on it are named, with their reason,
 * in {@link SECTION_SCOPED_PATH_OPTION_CALLERS} — a list that may only SHRINK
 * (gated by test/unit/media_ingest_properties_native.test.ts).

 * The call sites that still resolve media path options WITHOUT a section_id, and

 * a RECORD, and every one of these has the record's id in hand at the call site.
 *
 * THE LIST MAY ONLY SHRINK. `media_ingest_properties_native.test.ts` scans the
 * repository for two-argument `resolveMediaPathOptions(` calls and asserts the
 * set equals these paths exactly — so a NEW section-scoped call site fails the
 * gate, and a migrated one must be struck from here in the same change.
 *
 * (Owned by other workstreams as of 2026-08-09; handed off, not silently left.
 * `src/core/media/file_ops.ts` was on this list for a few hours on that day and
