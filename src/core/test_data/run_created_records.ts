/**
 * THE RECORDS A CLIENT RUN CREATED — and the rows the engine wrote ABOUT them.
 *
 * WHY. A browser suite builds its situation through the engine's own doors:
 * it creates test3 records (`create`) and deletes them again (`delete`,
 * delete_mode 'delete_record'). The record rows go, but the engine also wrote
 * rows ABOUT those records that a delete keeps by design — the delete's
 * time-machine snapshot (matrix_time_machine: the undo of a delete) and the
 * create/delete activity (matrix_activity dd542, locator in misc.dd551). The
 * post-run reseed (seed.ts restoreCanonicalTest3) deliberately leaves TM
 * history alone, so every run added its created records' history to the SUITE
 * database for good (the export suite alone: ~80 snapshots per run).
 *
 * WHAT IT SWEEPS — exactly the records CREATED during the run, nothing older:
 * the runner reads the section's counter AFTER its pre-run reseed
 * (`runCounterMark`), and after the run deletes, for section_ids ABOVE that
 * mark, the leftover record rows, their time-machine rows and their dd542
 * activity rows. An id is allocated by raising that counter (GREATEST), so an
 * id above the mark is one this run's creates allocated; the canonical
 * playground and every earlier row lie at or below it. (Not an id BAND: the
 * mark is measured per run, on the marked suite database — never a range
 * assumed "clear of genuine records".)
 *
 * WHAT "THIS RUN" RESTS ON — the sweep's actual rule is "every row of the
 * section ABOVE the mark", whoever wrote it (pinned by
 * run_created_records_native leg D: a raw row planted above the counter, as the
 * explicit-id export gates plant theirs, is swept too). That equals "created by
 * this run" only because the suite database has ONE test run at a time: a
 * concurrent `bun test` and `bun run test:client` on one suite database is
 * UNSUPPORTED, and not because of this sweep — both reseed test3 WHOLESALE
 * (seed.ts restoreCanonicalTest3 deletes every test3 row: test/helpers/
 * test_data.ts on each test process, client_test_runner.ts before the run),
 * so either run already wipes the other's records.
 *
 * SUITE DATABASE ONLY: both doors refuse a database the suite has not marked
 * (assertTestDatabase, the marker owner's API) before reading or writing.
