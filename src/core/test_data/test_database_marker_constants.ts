/**
 * THE MARKER'S TWO CONSTANTS, IN A MODULE THAT IMPORTS NOTHING.
 *
 * Split out of `test_database_marker.ts` (2026-08-25, coverage plan §4.4 D13)
 * for exactly one reason: `scripts/test_db_setup.ts` must ASK a target database
 * for the marker BEFORE it drops it, and it must ask over its own short-lived
 * `psql` subprocess. Importing the marker module would pull in
 * `src/core/db/postgres.ts`, whose pool connects at MODULE SCOPE — and a live
 * session on the target makes the very `DROP DATABASE` this check protects fail
 * with "being accessed by other users". A dependency-free module is the only
 * shape both sides can share.
 *
 * A second COPY of the name was not an option: `test_db_marker_tripwire` rule 5
 * scans `src/`, `tools/` and `scripts/` and allows the literal in exactly one
 * file. So this is the split the media root's protest-duplicate
 * (`test/helpers/test_media_root.ts`) could not have — one definition, zero
 * drift, no equality gate needed.
 *
 * Everything the marker MEANS — the row shape, the five properties, the one
 * producer — stays in `test_database_marker.ts`, which re-exports both names so
 * every engine-side consumer keeps ONE import site. This file is the name and
 * the sentence, and must never grow an import.
