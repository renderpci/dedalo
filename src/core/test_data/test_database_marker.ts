/**
 * THE TEST-DATABASE MARKER — the MECHANICAL half of "a test never writes to
 * production data" (AGENTS.md hard rules, 2026-08-19).
 *
 * WHY A MARKER AT ALL. Until now the guarantee rested on two conventions:
 * the suite runs on a database whose NAME is derived (`<app db>_test`,
 * test/helpers/test_database.ts), and each test-data door REMEMBERS to check
 * something (`test_tld_materialize`'s `expectDatabase`, the media kit's
 * `.dedalo_test_media` file). Dédalo runs in production with irreplaceable
 * heritage data and the suite must be runnable at any moment, so "the name
 * looks like a test name" and "the author remembered" are not the class of
 * guarantee this needs. A NAME is a claim about a database; the marker is the
 * database ITSELF asserting what it is, and every writer asks it.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT CANNOT HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. One dedicated table,
 * `dedalo_test_marker`, holding exactly one row:
 *
 *   id              integer PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1)   — one row, by the DB
 *   purpose         text CHECK (purpose = <the literal below>)
 *   database_name   text  — the database this marker was WRITTEN INTO
 *   build_stamp     text  — ISO instant of the `test:db:setup` run
 *   git_rev         text  — the checkout that built it
 *   seed_sha256     text  — sha256 of install/db/dedalo_install.pgsql.gz
 *   ontology_sha256 text  — sha256 of src/core/test_data/test_tld_ontology.json
 *   created_at      timestamptz
 *
 * Five properties make it a real guarantee rather than a second convention:
 *
 *  1. NO OTHER PRODUCER. The table is in no install seed, in no
 *     `install/db/migrations/` file, and the engine never creates it at boot.
 *     `scripts/test_db_setup.ts` writes it, immediately after CREATE DATABASE
 *     on a database it has just dropped and rebuilt — nothing else in the tree
 *     calls `writeTestDatabaseMarker`.
 *  2. THE PURPOSE SENTENCE IS A CHECK CONSTRAINT. A hand-typed
 *     `CREATE TABLE dedalo_test_marker(...)` on a production database does not
 *     accidentally reproduce a 130-character sentence, an id-is-1 constraint
 *     and six mandatory columns. Creating this by mistake is not a slip; it is
 *     a paragraph of deliberate typing that says what it is doing.
 *  3. IT NAMES ITS OWN DATABASE. `database_name` is verified against
 *     `current_database()` on every read. Restoring a dump OF the test database
 *     into the application's database — the one realistic way a marker could
 *     travel — produces a marker naming the wrong database, and the guard
 *     refuses LOUDER than if there were none (that is a misrouted restore, and
 *     the operator should hear about it).
 *  4. IT IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. `assertTestDatabase(door)` is the ONE door
 *     every test-data writer calls first; `test/unit/test_db_marker_tripwire.test.ts`
 *     enumerates the writers from the SOURCE, so a new writer that forgets is red.
 *  5. IT IS PROVENANCE, NOT JUST A FLAG. The three stamps answer "which build
 *     is this database, and is it stale?" — the question that used to be
 *     answered by guessing.
 *
 * CHEAP TO READ. The hit path is a Map lookup, the miss path two small
 * queries. The Map comes from the sanctioned cache factory (module_state_tripwire
 * forbids module-level mutable state), and a NEGATIVE is never cached: a
 * database that has no marker must be re-asked, because a probe may have
 * removed the row inside a transaction it then rolls back (that is exactly how
 * the tripwire proves the refusal is real). Caching a POSITIVE for the process
 * is safe: the connection is frozen at config import (src/config/config.ts),
 * so one process never changes database under itself.
 *
 * THE ONE BYPASS. `src/core/install/db_restore.ts` materializes the `test` TLD
 * ONTOLOGY on a fresh REAL install (definitions, no records) — the one
 * legitimate test-data call outside a test database. It opts out explicitly
 * with `allowAnyDatabase: true` on `materializeTestTldOntology`, which is the
 * ONLY bypass in the tree and is asserted to be by the tripwire.
