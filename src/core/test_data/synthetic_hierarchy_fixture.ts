/**
 * THE SYNTHETIC HIERARCHY FIXTURE — two GENERATED thesauri in the generic
 * `test*` namespace, replacing the imported real geography the suite fixture
 * used to carry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-25). The suite database imported REAL
 * geographic thesauri (`install/import/hierarchy/<tld>1.copy.gz`, one country
 * each) and component/search gates then asserted against Spain's and France's
 * actual toponymy — the exact violation the generic-`test`-TLD law names
 * (AGENTS.md hard rules): a gate green only against one install's records
 * tests that install, not the engine. The bulk import was 7612 MB, 97.6% of it
 * this geography plus its trigger-derived rows; the derived allowlist cut it
 * to ~140k real toponymy records (Spain 69,889 / France 41,212 / … — tipos deliberately not spelled: the allowlist scan counts comments), and dropping
 * four whole countries (it, ma, pt, tn — 103,536 rows) broke NOTHING — proof
 * the record CONTENT was never what the gates tested. What the census of every
 * consumer actually needs is SHAPE, not Spain:
 *   - TWO ACTIVATED HIERARCHIES with DISTINCT model twins reachable through
 *     the hierarchy1 registry pairing (hierarchy53 -> terms, hierarchy58 ->
 *     model), so `getModelSectionForSection` and the datalist cache-key cases
 *     resolve X1 -> X2 and Y1 -> Y2 (datalist_cache_key_native,
 *     relation_corpus_config);
 *   - virtual-section registration over hierarchy20
 *     (virtual_section_list_columns: getSectionRealTipo === 'hierarchy20');
 *   - ROW VOLUME in ONE terms section: search_late_row_lookup pages at offset
 *     SEARCH_LATE_ROW_LOOKUP_OFFSET (default 1000) + 200 with limit 25 and
 *     asserts a non-empty page => >= 1,226 rows. The count here is DERIVED
 *     from the live config default at seed time (never a bare constant), so a
 *     raised default cannot silently starve the gate;
 *   - a TERM-TEXT DISTRIBUTION: >= 3 short names each with
 *     exact-unaccent-match count >= 1 AND contains-count strictly greater,
 *     contains corpus in the hundreds (search_string_equal_operator re-derives
 *     its ground truth in-test — the property is the distribution, not any
 *     country's toponymy);
 *   - record id 1 EXISTING in the terms section while user 0 holds no read
 *     grant on it (indexation_grid_tc_native's AUTHZ-05 premise) — the root
 *     term the activation itself mints;
 *   - 2–3 levels of depth for tree sanity (root -> probe branches -> leaves).
 *     NO consumer asserts ancestor chains against stored hierarchy rows, so
 *     depth is sanity, not load-bearing. No dates: the date gates ride the
 *     canonical matrix_test fixture. ONE data lang: no consumer asserts
 *     multilingual hierarchy terms (original_lang builds its own records).
 *
 * HOW IT IS BUILT — the engine's own doors, never a raw COPY:
 *   1. `activateHierarchy` (the installer's door) registers each TLD in the
 *      hierarchy1 registry, provisions the `<tld>0|1|2` ontology, registers
 *      the virtual sections over hierarchy20, flags them ACTIVE with FULL
 *      locators, and mints the root term (`<tld>1`/1) and model root
 *      (`<tld>2`/1) — the same convergence a real install runs.
 *   2. The term corpus goes through `insertMatrixRecordWithExplicitId`
 *      (matrix_write's explicit-id door: advisory-locked, counter-raising, the
 *      same door situations use), with the SAME column shapes the vendored
 *      imports carry — so the AFTER INSERT triggers derive
 *      matrix_relation_index / matrix_string_search rows exactly as for real
 *      data. Deterministic: names and parents are pure functions of the id (no
 *      Math.random — a non-deterministic fixture is not a fixture).
 *
 * ROW COUNTS (from the census, stated not guessed): hierarchy A
 * (`testgeoa1`) = max(1300, offset+300) rows — 1,300 at the shipped default,
 * >= 1,226 required by the paging arithmetic, margin on top; hierarchy B
 * (`testgeob1`) = 10 rows — existence and a distinct twin are all its
 * consumers need. Model twins hold ONLY the engine-minted model root at id 1;
 * ids 2..941000 stay free (the datalist gate seeds its own options at
 * 941001+). Grand total ~1,310 generated records where the imports carried
 * ~140,000.
 *
 * Idempotent (re-activation converges; the corpus is swept-above-root and
 * re-inserted) and tearable (`dropSyntheticHierarchies` mirrors the
 * install_hierarchy_activate_native sweep). Guarded: `assertTestDatabase`
 * before the first write, like every test-data writer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. It cannot prove the migrated consumer gates hold
 * the same law they held against real data — each migration must re-derive its
 * ground truth against THIS corpus (the string-equality gate especially).
 * It does not exercise the `.copy.gz` IMPORT path (install_hierarchy_tools
 * owns that, against a vendored file in its own scratch database), and it does
 * not replace the LANGUAGES thesaurus: that one is engine-hardwired
 * (select_lang, pinned ids in import gates) and stays a REAL import.
