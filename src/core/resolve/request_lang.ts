/**
 * Request-scoped effective languages (PHP DEDALO_APPLICATION_LANG /
 * DEDALO_DATA_LANG, which PHP defines as per-request constants seeded from the
 * user's session at bootstrap).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (spec §4, plan risk A5.1): Bun is a long-lived process, so
 * the "current language" can NOT be a module-level value the way PHP's
 * per-request constants effectively were — that would bleed one user's language
 * choice into every concurrent request. Instead the effective languages live in
 * an AsyncLocalStorage scope opened once per RQO at the dispatch chokepoint
 * (dispatchRqo) from the caller's session. Leaf resolvers (label lookup, data
 * reads, page_globals) read them through the accessors below; outside any scope
 * (unit tests calling resolvers directly, background jobs) they fall back to the
 * installation defaults, so behavior is identical to before whenever no user
 * override is in effect.
 *
 * This is the same AsyncLocalStorage pattern already used for the transaction
 * handle in core/db/postgres.ts — the boring, consistent choice (§2b).

 * behalf. `DEDALO_DATA_LANG` is the MENU's current selection, a per-user thing
 * whose configured value is only a starting point, and it is NOT in the data
 * fallback chain (`resolve/component_data.ts`): a write stamped with it can land
 * in a slice no read resolves. `DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT` IS that chain's first
 * candidate and is always a declared data language
 * (`src/config/data_langs.ts`), so a job's write is reachable by construction.
