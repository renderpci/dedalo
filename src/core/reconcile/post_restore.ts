/**
 * POST-RESTORE PLAN — what the reconcile registry does right after a DATA
 * restore (audit 2026-08-26 S-7; the door is
 * src/core/area_maintenance/restore_door.ts, phase 5 — `restore` mode only:
 * a rehearsal into another database never runs it, because the registry runs
 * through the pool and the pool is bound to the configured database).
 *
 * WHY A PLAN AND NOT "run everything --apply". A restore rolls the matrix back
 * to the artifact's instant; the stores beside it (the media tree, the
 * publication marker store, observer mirror slots, the vector index, the
 * `dd_ontology` projection, the hierarchy provisioning) were NOT rolled back.
 * Every registered reconcile is therefore worth RUNNING — but only two are
 * safe to APPLY unattended:
 *
 *  - `counters_media` is raise-only and idempotent: the allocator's floor cannot
 *    see files of records created after the backup (PRODUCTION.md §6.1 step 5,
 *    "only the disk remembers"), and raising a counter never destroys anything.
 *  - `media_index` is a pure derivation (`pub/` recomputed from `dbs/`), the
 *    same auto-apply the boot scheduler already performs.
 *
 * The rest report DRIFT and hold: a `files_info` SHRINK, an observer-mirror
 * recompute, a destructive ontology re-projection, a hierarchy `ensure` are an
 * operator's decision, with the dry report in view — exactly the posture
 * PRODUCTION.md §6.5 gives the scheduler.
 *
 * TOTAL OVER THE REGISTRY. The plan names EVERY `REGISTERED_NAMES` entry with
 * an explicit apply/dry verdict and a reason (the gate holds the two sets
 * equal), so an eighth reconcile cannot land without deciding what a restore
 * does with it. A step that throws is recorded by its error CODE and the plan
 * continues: the restore already happened, and one store's reconcile failing
 * must not hide the other six verdicts from the operator.
