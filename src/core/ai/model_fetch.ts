/**
 * MODEL DOWNLOADER — pull one model's files from the public hub into the local
 * store. The ONE implementation behind both doors:
 *
 *   - `scripts/fetch_ai_models.ts` (the operator CLI, with a progress bar);
 *   - the tool's admin-gated `download_model` action (quiet, in a background job),
 *     which is how an administrator seeds a model from the browser without shell
 *     access to the server.
 *
 * Downloading is an OPERATOR/ADMIN act, distinct from `DEDALO_AI_MODEL_ALLOW_HUB`:
 * that flag governs whether the BROWSER may stream weights from the hub at
 * inference time (a per-recording privacy leak); this module runs on the server,
 * once per model, on an explicit request. An air-gapped install simply gets a
 * clean failure here and seeds the store by rsync instead.
 *
 * Transport is `curl` (resume, retry, and — observed on this project's own dev
 * box — Bun's fetch stalling outright against the hub's CDN redirect), with a
 * fetch fallback for hosts without curl. Files land only under the store root,
 * and only for model ids the CALLER has already validated against the catalog —
 * this module never invents a URL from user input on its own.
 *
 * PINNED AND VERIFIED (2026-09-04, P1-25 / CARRY-06). A file is fetched at the
 * IMMUTABLE hub revision recorded in `model_pins.json` — never the mutable
 * `main` head — and after transport its bytes are sha256-hashed against the pin
 * BEFORE the manifest records completion. A mismatch is quarantined under
 * `<store>/.quarantine` (evidence kept, file never served) and reported as a
 * refusal; a model with no pin is refused before any byte, because a download
 * the engine cannot verify is a download it must not make. The transport's
 * `-C -` resume is exactly why the length test was never enough: a resumed file
 * can carry the head of one object and the tail of another at the right length.
 *
 * The DECISIONS live in three pure exports — `resolveFetchTarget` (path
 * confinement + URL policy), `curlArgv` (transport flags) and
 * `isUsableCachedFile` (cache freshness) — gated by
 * `test/unit/ai_model_fetch_native.test.ts`. What remains is byte plumbing,
 * split one concern per function (`acceptCached` / `verifyAndRecord` for the
 * digest verdict and manifest bookkeeping, `curlFetch` / `plainFetch` — over `idleAbort` /
 * `streamToFile` / `pumpToWriter` — and `transport` for the wire),
 * so `fetchOneFile` reads as the six-line sequence it is. The whole path —
 * transport included — is driven against a LOOPBACK hub by
 * `test/unit/model_artifact_integrity_native.test.ts`; the orchestration in
 * `downloadModel` is also drivable through the injectable `options.fetchFile`.
