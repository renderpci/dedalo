/**
 * PICKER CONSTRAINT — the ONE resolver behind the thesaurus picker's
 * affordances AND behind the relation write chokepoint that persists a pick.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ONE MODULE. The picker asks two questions and the save asks the
 * same two: "which sections may this caller link into" and "how many more may
 * it hold". Answered twice, the two answers drift and the UI offers what the
 * write refuses (or, worse, the reverse). So the read path (the area picker
 * read, which decides what the tree renders) and the write path
 * (`relations/save.ts validateRelationInsert`) both call the functions here —
 * the affordance and the persistence answer are literally the same value.
 * Nothing the request carries feeds them: the caller ddo names itself and the
 * server derives the rest (picker plan §1.2 — a client-declared cap or target
 * set is a second authority that can be forged or go stale).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO (picker plan §1.8, the table). The caller's
 * request_config contributes EXACTLY ONE fact: which section(s) the picker
 * opens. It does NOT bound the tree (a thesaurus is browsed, not paged — no
 * `sqo_config.limit` is read here), it does NOT render the tree (the caller's
 * `ddo_map` governs how a LINKED value is displayed back in the caller, and is
 * never pushed into the picker), and it does NOT decide selectability. The
 * only count that exists is the caller's own `properties.data_limit`.
 *
 * PER-TERM SELECTABILITY IS THE TERM'S OWN ANSWER (picker plan §1.9) — see
 * {@link isTermSelectable}: relation mode means the thesaurus itself declares,
 * term by term, what may be linked. That rule is `ts_object.isIndexable` and is
 * NOT reimplemented here.

 * The sections a TOOL declares as picker sources for this caller.

 * `properties.tool_config.<tool>.ddo_map` wires a set of ddos into one working
 * surface, and some of those entries are SECTIONS the operator picks from,
 * published into a sibling entry that is a relation component. tool_indexation
 * is the live case: its map pairs `indexing_component` (rsc860, the portal that
 * stores the links) with `people_section` (rsc197, a plain section browsed as a
 * thesaurus list), and `tool_indexation.js` assigns
 * `people_section.linker = indexing_component`. Nothing in rsc860's own
 * request_config — hierarchies, from `source: 'hierarchy_types'` — names
 * rsc197, so gate 1 of the write door refused a link the tool exists to make
 * (`off_target`), while the client offered the affordance from the tool_config
 * it had rendered. Two authorities declared what may be linked and only one was
 * enforced; this reads the other one, from the SAME ontology bytes the client
 * was handed, so the affordance and the persistence stay one answer.
 *
 * PAIRED BY ROLE, NEVER BY CROSS-PRODUCT. The pair comes from
 * `tools/picker_wiring.ts` — the mirror of the tool's own single JS assignment,
 * married to it by `tool_picker_wiring_tripwire`. Within one `ddo_map`, for
 * each declared `{sourceRole, linkerRole}`:
 *   - the SOURCE entry must carry that role, resolve to a SECTION, and name a
 *     literal `section_tipo` (a 'self' sentinel is the host section, not a
 *     picker source, and there is no runtime context here to resolve it). The
 *     model is read from the ontology, never from the entry: the stored ddo_map
 *     carries no `model` key at all — `enrichToolConfig` stamps it for the wire
 *     from exactly this lookup;
 *   - the LINKER entry must carry that role AND be of the PORTAL family
 *     ({@link LINKER_MODELS}) — the components whose stored value IS a browsed
 *     record link. `getModelByTipo` canonicalizes the family
 *     (component_autocomplete / _hi → component_portal).
 *
 * WHY NOT "every section in the map to every relation component in it". That
 * cross-product was the first shape of this function and it over-granted twice
 * over on the live map: to `references_component` (rsc1368, a display list no
 * pick ever reaches) and — before the family narrowing — to the status checkbox
 * and select (rsc437/rsc439), whose values come from their own option lists. A
 * ddo_map wires a whole working surface; only one pair of it is a link
 * declaration, and widening a WRITE gate on a guess about the rest is the class
 * of write gate 1 exists to refuse. The role check makes the grant exactly as
 * wide as the tool's behaviour, and the tripwire is what keeps that true.
 *
 * NOT A GRANT. This widens the TARGET gate only. Gates 2-4 (the read grant on
 * the linked section, selectability, the cap) run unchanged on every locator
