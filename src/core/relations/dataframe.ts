/**
 * DATAFRAME id_key ENGINE (RELATIONS_SPEC.md §6.2) — the pairing machinery
 * connecting frame records to INDIVIDUAL data items of a main component.
 *
 * A dataframe works like any relation (it points to target section(s) and
 * stores locators in the relations bag), but each frame locator is connected
 * to ONE data item of its main component via `id_key → id`: the locator's
 * `id_key` equals the stable, server-minted `id` of the main item. The main
 * component can be ANY component — relation or literal (text, date, iri, …).
 * Frames extend the main data (uncertainty, context, qualifiers) without
 * polluting it.
 *
 * PHP references: class.component_dataframe.php (get_data :103 filtered by
 * caller, set_data :187 sibling-preserving merge + id_key stamping :205-213,
 * $test_equal_properties :82), trait.dataframe_common.php (predicate :82,
 * inline *_by_id_key API :833-960 — the value-item variant used by the
 * relation sibling-order component_number).
 *
 * The pure match predicate lives in concepts/subdatum.ts; this module holds
 * the slot read/merge algebra and the inline-value API as pure functions
 * over item arrays (the save pipeline and Phase D children order consume
 * them), plus ONE persistence helper: fixDataframeOrphanEntries, the
 * lock-and-per-key write half of the integrity fix-mode (S2-06).

 * the main-item cascade (removeDataframeDataById) and the direct frame
 * removal (the dataframe modal's Delete button → `action:'remove'` on the
 * slot itself).
 *
 * The policy is a fact about the SLOT and its target section (a frame-private
 * `rsc1242` rating is meaningless unlinked; a shared target is not), so it is
 * read from the slot node's properties, never from the main's — a main with
 * two frames may want two answers. Until this entry the engine read
 * `dataframe.delete_policy` from the MAIN node, which no shipped node ever
 * carried, while the docs and the resolver tripline put it on the slot.
 *
 * - `unlink`        — locators leave; the target survives (default).
 * - `delete_target` — soft: deleteSectionData, row kept, components emptied,
 *                     recoverable from Time Machine. The PHP opt-in.
 *
 * THERE IS NO HARD VALUE (2026-09-29,
 * WC-2026-09-29-dataframe-hard-delete-retired). A frame target is never
 * removed as a row: a past state of the main renders its frame through the
 * target, so a deleted target makes Time Machine lie about history. That is
 * why v6 RETIRED `properties.hard_delete: true` on purpose — its client branch
 * was commented out with "REMOVED because time machine needs to show the
 * previous state, so, never deletes it". The key stays on ~58 slot nodes and
 * is INERT (RETIRED_PROPERTY_KEYS, ontology/property_census.ts); the
 * 2026-09-06 entry that read it as a hard delete misread that retirement.
 * Anything but `delete_target` — `hard_delete`, a `delete_target_record`
 * written in that window, a typo — is `unlink`: an unknown spelling never

 * that can share that transaction: `deleteSectionData` snapshots, empties
 * every component, then moves the emptied media components' files — an
 * irreversible step. Run inline inside the save's transaction it would
 * happen BEFORE the save committed, and a later failure of the same save
 * would roll the data and the locator back while the files sat under
 * `deleted/`.
 * So inside an ambient transaction the deletes are queued on the COMMIT-ONLY
 * lane (registerCommitAction): they run after COMMIT, with no ambient
 * transaction, each delete opening its own — and on ROLLBACK the queue is
 * discarded, so a target is never deleted while a locator still points at it.
 * With no ambient transaction (a script, a test) they run right here.

 * grammar is "unlinked; the target's wipe follows the commit".
 *

 * it here, and the data wipe is handed it: it writes a role-4 twin of its
 * whole-record snapshot carrying the run id (time_machine.ts
 * recordBulkCascadeDelete), so the run's revert can find, restore and report
 * what its cascade emptied. The media moves stay irreversible — the revert
 * reports them as inexact (decision D3). A nested cascade (a wiped target's
