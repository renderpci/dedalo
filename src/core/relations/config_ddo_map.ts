/**
 * MULTI-ENGINE ddo-map FLATTENING — the shared step that makes a component with
 * MORE THAN ONE request_config item resolve every one of them.
 *
 * A relation component may declare several config items: a `main` + a
 * `secondary` scope (numisdata573's two hierarchy filters), or — the case this
 * module exists for — a `dedalo` item plus a non-dedalo one (rsc368 declares
 * dedalo + zenon; five nodes in this installation do). Until this landed, every
 * consumer took `request_config[0]`, so the SECOND item's children were never
 * resolved at all: rsc368's zenon1 locators expanded through the dedalo item's
 * ddos, matched none of them (per-locator section_tipo filter), and rendered an
 * empty cell.
 *
 * NO api_engine BRANCH LIVES HERE, and none may. Dispatch stays
 * model-polymorphic exactly as the oracle does it: the flattened map is filtered
 * PER LOCATOR by the locator's own `section_tipo` (relation_core.expandPortal),
 * so a zenon1 locator sees only the ddos declared at zenon1 and an rsc205
 * locator only the dedalo ones. The engine name never enters the read path.
 *
 * ORACLE: class.common.php:2312-2341 (`full_ddo_map`), reproduced faithfully:
 *  - every item contributes `show.ddo_map` then `hide.ddo_map` (hide ddos are
 *    server-resolved data the client widgets consume without rendering as
 *    columns — numisdata585's hierarchy31 feeds the map observer);
 *  - an item whose SHOW map is empty is SKIPPED WHOLE — its hide map does not
 *    contribute either (PHP `continue`s before the hide push, :2325) — and the
 *    skip is logged, because PHP logs it as a WARNING and the usual cause is a
 *    permission drop that emptied the map;
 *  - duplicates are removed keeping the FIRST occurrence.
 *
 * THE HIDE MAP IS EMISSION-ONLY. `full_ddo_map` is what the CLIENT gets; the
 * FLAT/EXPORT consumer (export atoms, list-cell JOIN) is built by PHP from
 * `show->ddo_map` alone — see `includeHideDdos` below for the oracle lines and
 * what leaks without it.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, in the dedup KEY. PHP keys on
 * `tipo + '_' + parent + '_' + json_encode(section_tipo)`; this keys on the
 * WHOLE normalised ddo. PHP's coarse key silently drops a second ddo that
 * differs only in `mode`, `lang`, `limit` or `value_with_parents` — two
 * genuinely different renders of the same component collapse into one. The
 * structural key never collapses two ddos that differ, so it is a strict
 * superset of what PHP keeps. Ledgered: engineering/wire_contract/
 * WC-2026-08-05-multi-engine-ddo-expansion.md.
 *
 * `section_tipo` is normalised for the KEY ONLY by sorting a COPY: it is a SET
 * of target sections, so [a,b] and [b,a] are the same ddo (PHP's json_encode is
 * order-sensitive and would keep both). The EMITTED ddo keeps the declared
 * array verbatim — flattening it to [0] is the numisdata6 §2 bug (a multi-target
 * child then matched only the first target section).
