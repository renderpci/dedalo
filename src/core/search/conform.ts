/**
 * SQO conform stage (Phase A of the two-phase search pipeline, spec §3.3).
 *
 * Walks the sanitized SQO's filter tree; for every LEAF:
 *   1. validates all identifiers at the §7.6 chokepoint (tipos, lang),
 *   2. resolves the component's model/column/translatability from the ontology,
 *   3. dispatches to the per-model fragment builder,
 * and returns a ConformedFilter tree whose leaves carry BuilderResults
 * (`fragment` — never an envelope `result`).
 *
 * PHP reference: search::parse_sqo/conform_filter (class.search.php:733/:809)
 * and the per-component resolve_query_object_sql traits.
 *
 * DISPATCH (header re-dated 2026-07-07, S2-45 — the old UNCOVERED list here
 * described long-landed gaps; coverage-state lists live in rewrite/STATUS.md):
 * non-relation models dispatch by their descriptor's `searchBuilder` family
 * (components/registry.ts, S2-26); relation-column models dispatch through
 * the relations registry. A model with no declared family and no relation
 * column throws loudly (plan §9 no-silent-narrowing) — that throw is the
 * ledger, not a bug.
