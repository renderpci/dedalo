/**
 * The harvesting door's own refusals — the `harvest.*` codes, built in ONE place.
 *
 * A cataloguer who pasted a URL must learn WHY it was not fetched: which site,
 * and what rule said no. So every `harvest.*` code puts `site` on the wire (and
 * `harvest.refused` its `reason` token), under `details_keys` the registry
 * declares — and nothing else. What `site` may be is the disclosure rule:
 *
 *   - the ORIGIN (scheme, host, port) the CALLER asked for — never a path, a
 *     query or credentials, never a resolved address. A redirect's target is
 *     chosen by the remote server and has not been vetted when a policy refuses
 *     it, so its host rides only in the LOG-ONLY `coordinates`;
 *   - for every ROBOTS verdict — `harvest.robots_disallowed`,
 *     `harvest.robots_unavailable`, and `harvest.refused` reasons
 *     `robots_too_complex` and `robots_redirect_refused` — the origin whose
 *     robots.txt decided. That origin
 *     already answered from a public address (its robots.txt request passed the
 *     SSRF guard), and naming it is the point: after a redirect it is the site
 *     that said no, not the one the cataloguer pasted;
 *   - for caller text that is not a URL at all, the fixed `UNPARSEABLE_SITE`
 *     token: such text has no origin, and echoing it would put whatever it holds
 *     (a path, a query, a password) into the public details.
 *
 * Address refusals are NOT here: they stay `security.ssrf_blocked` (operator
 * disclosure — core/security/ssrf_guard.ts), because naming what an address
 * resolved to is exactly the internal-network oracle that code exists to deny.
