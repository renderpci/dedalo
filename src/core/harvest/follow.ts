/**
 * Redirects, followed ONE VETTED HOP AT A TIME.
 *
 * A redirect is a new target the server chose for us. `fetchGuardedText` answers
 * that by refusing every redirect, which is right for an API call and wrong for a
 * harvester: catalogue sites move pages, add `www.`, and upgrade to https. So the
 * harvesting door follows them — but only by re-running, for EVERY hop, the whole
 * policy the first URL passed:
 *
 *   - http(s) only, no credentials in the URL (a user name alone included), and
 *     never https → http (a downgrade hands the rest of the exchange to anyone on
 *     the path); https only, when the caller asked for `requireHttps`;
 *   - the caller's HOST policy (a public-only policy, or an allowlist);
 *   - a URL no longer than `MAX_URL_LENGTH` (every per-hop check is linear in
 *     it, and a hostile redirect can mint any length it likes — robots matching,
 *     whose cost is ALSO the rule count, weighs its own work: `robots.ts`);
 *   - the caller's own per-hop check (robots.txt, pacing — `harvest.ts`), whose
 *     `done` is held until the hop has answered, and is told what it answered;
 *   - the public-address check and the socket pin, inside `fetchPinnedHop`.
 *
 * At most `MAX_REDIRECTS` redirects are followed — the sixth is a refusal, never
 * a silent stop on a 3xx. A `Location` that is not a URL is a refusal too, never a
 * raw TypeError. Every refusal is `harvest.refused` with its reason token
 * (`refusals.ts`); the redirect target's host rides only in the log.
