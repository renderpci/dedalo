/**
 * Database backup (PHP core/backup/class.backup.php init_backup_sequence +
 * get_backup_files, behind the make_backup maintenance widget) — TS-NATIVE:
 * the server dumps the application database with its own pg_dump into its
 * backup directory (`getBackupDir`: DEDALO_BACKUP_DIR, else
 * <privateDir>/backups/db). File naming and the custom-format dump command
 * keep the PHP-era shape, so existing backup sets stay readable:
 *
 *   <Y-m-d_His>.<db>.postgresql_<user>_forced_dbv<maj-min-patch>.custom.backup
 *   pg_dump -F c -b -f <that name>.part <db>  (spawned detached)
 *
 * The throttled (non-forced) window naming (<Y-m-d_H>… + the 8h
 * DEDALO_BACKUP_TIME_RANGE guard) applies when skipTimeRange is false.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS NOT USABILITY (audit P0-13, 2026-08-30). Until that date the
 * only thing this module asked of a finished dump was `existsSync && size > 0`,
 * so a pg_dump killed at 60% left an artifact that the widget listed, that
 * `newestBackupMtimeMs` counted, and that satisfied the code-update
 * precondition — the operator swapped the whole code tree believing they had a
 * restore point. The restore-point verdict now lives in
 * `verifyBackupArtifact` / `newestUsableBackup` at the foot of this file, and
 * `newestBackupMtimeMs` keeps its honest, narrow meaning: RECENCY only.
 *
 * A DUMP IN FLIGHT IS NOT A BACKUP (OPS-2, 2026-09-30): pg_dump writes
 * `<final>.part`, and only two doors ever give bytes the final name — see THE
 * NAME GRAMMAR below for what each door proves. An orphaned part is adopted by a
 * full read, never deleted. ONE VERDICT (OPS-1, 2026-09-30): every "is this a
 * restore point" question is the full `pg_restore` read, asked asynchronously,
 * shared, serialized and budgeted — see the verification section's header.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * THE NAME GRAMMAR (OPS-2, audit 2026-09-26) — built ONCE, here.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-30 the grammar lived twice (this module and the make_backup
 * widget's own literal), so the panel could advertise one name while the dump
 * landed at another. And pg_dump's `-f` pointed straight at the FINAL name: for
 * the whole life of a dump — minutes to hours — a partial archive sat under the
 * one suffix every scanner matches. The widget listed it, the freshness scan
 * judged it, and a second claimant of the same name judged the LIVE dump
 * "disproved" (a header-only prefix is not an archive yet) and retired it from
 * under its own pg_dump.
 *
 * THE LAW NOW: in-flight bytes live at `<final>.part` (claimed atomically,
 * `open wx`), and exactly TWO doors give a part of ours a `.backup` name — never
 * over an existing file (`renameNoClobber`). They do NOT prove the same thing:
 *
 * - `publishDump` (our own dump, whose exit status we saw): pg_dump exited 0 AND
 *   - a full read proved the bytes → PROVEN (`<final>.verified` sidecar), or
 *   - the read could not LOOK (no pg_restore on this host, or it outran its
 *     budget) → COMPLETED, UNVERIFIED (no sidecar; every later freshness ask
 *     reads it afresh, and a timed-out read does not count as a restore point);
 * - `adoptOrphanedParts` (a part whose writer's exit status nobody saw): a full
 *   read alone proved the bytes → PROVEN (sidecar). Nothing else is adopted.
 *
 * So a `*.backup` of ours is either proven by a full read (sidecar present) or a
 * dump that exited 0 and has not been read yet — never a dump known to have
 * failed. `deploy/dedalo-db-backup.sh` follows the same `.part` → full read →
 * rename shape for the nightly timer's dumps (it has no unverified door: without
 * a completed read it refuses).

 *   .log nobody surfaced, while the widget reported success);
 * - a short fast-fail window catches immediate exits (auth/connection errors)

 * WHY A JOB, NOT A BARE PFILE (OPS-2 review, 2026-09-30). The status record used
 * to be a pfile written by hand, owned by the pg_dump CHILD's pid. After pg_dump
 * exits the promotion still has a full read to do (seconds per GB, plus its turn
 * in the one-read-at-a-time slot) — and in that window the record said `running`
 * under a DEAD owner, so the widget's next poll ran the lazy reconcile and
 * flipped a SUCCESSFUL backup to `interrupted`. A job registered with the job
 * manager is owned by this server process for its whole life, dump AND
 * verification: the poll reads it from the registry, and only a server that
 * actually died leaves it to the reconcile. It spends a `maintenance` slot, which
 * is what a whole-database dump is; it has no deadline (its length is the
 * database's size); a user STOP kills the dump (the part is then retired), a
 * server SHUTDOWN does not (the dump may finish, and `adoptOrphanedParts`
 * promotes it later).
 *
 * TWO IDENTITIES, deliberately apart: `userId` is the one the FILE NAME carries

 * RESTORE-POINT VERIFICATION (audit P0-13, 2026-08-30; OPS-1, 2026-09-30)
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS SECTION EXISTS TO PREVENT: the old `artifactIsUsable` was
 * `existsSync(file) && size > 0`. A pg_dump killed at 60% leaves a large,
 * non-empty, PERFECTLY FRESH file — it passed, the widget listed it, the
 * update panel counted it, and the code-update precondition told the operator
 * they had a restore point before they replaced the whole code tree.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CHECK ACTUALLY PROVES (measured 2026-08-30 on this machine, against
 * the 400 MB `2026-07-11_102750….custom.backup` artifact, pg_restore 17):
 *
 *   pg_restore --list        0.03 s. Reads header + TOC only (the archive is
 *                            seekable), so it catches a NON-archive, a garbage
 *                            or error-text file, and a death early enough to
 *                            cut the header/TOC (a 2 KB prefix fails with
 *                            "could not read from input file: end of file").
 *                            It does NOT catch data truncation: the same
 *                            archive cut to 60% (240 MB) STILL listed all 1121
 *                            entries and exited 0. Used here ONLY as a fast
 *                            FAIL — it never produces a positive verdict.
 *   pg_restore -f /dev/null  2.97 s on the whole 400 MB archive (~7.4 s/GB,
 *                            no server connection — it emits SQL to the file).
 *                            Reads and decompresses EVERY data block, so the
 *                            60% copy fails in 1.7 s with the same EOF error.
 *                            This is the only read that disproves truncation,
 *                            and it is the ONLY positive verdict there is.
 *   pg_dump's own exit 0     The only proof the dump ran to COMPLETION; nothing
 *                            read back from the file can substitute for it,
 *                            which is why our own dumps are promoted only after
 *                            it (publishDump).
 *
 * ONE QUESTION (OPS-1). Until 2026-09-30 the freshness path asked the CHEAP
 * question (`--list`, a `verified_toc` verdict "usable but unproven"), so a dump
 * that died at 60% counted as a fresh restore point and the unwaived code update
 * swapped the tree. The cheap verdict is gone: every caller — the require path,
 * the panel, the throttle, the restore door — asks the full read.
 *
 * COST DISCIPLINE, now that the one question is the expensive one:
 * - ASYNC. `pg_restore` runs as a child the event loop awaits; nothing here
 *   freezes the single-threaded server (it used to be `spawnSync`).
 * - PAID ONCE per artifact: a decisive verdict is cached in a
 *   `<artifact>.verified` sidecar keyed on (size, mtime); our own dumps get
 *   theirs at promotion, so no one waits on them at all.
 * - SINGLE-FLIGHT: concurrent askers of one file (`verifyInFlight`) and of one
 *   directory generation (`scanInFlight`) share ONE read.
 * - SERIALIZED: at most one full read runs at a time in the process
 *   (`deepReadSlot`); its budget clock starts when it gets the slot.
 * - CAPPED at MAX_VERIFY_CANDIDATES artifacts per scan.
 * - BOUNDED on HTTP: the panel and update_data_version race the shared scan
 *   against PANEL_WAIT_MS and say `verifying` — never `ok` — when it loses. Only
 *   the require path (the code update, inside its background job) awaits the
 *   settled verdict.
 * - BUDGETED by size (`verifyBudgetMs`, DEDALO_BACKUP_VERIFY_SECONDS_PER_GB).
 *
 * DEGRADATION: when we CANNOT judge an artifact because of THIS HOST (no
 * pg_restore) or THIS FORMAT (a foreign, non-custom dump under a name OTHER than
 * our `.custom.backup` suffix) the verdict stays `usable: true, verified: false` —
 * refusing a legitimate update over a format we never claimed to verify would be
 * an outage. Our own suffix without the archive magic is `not_an_archive`: that
 * name is our grammar, and a zero-filled file under it is a corpse. A read that OUTRAN ITS BUDGET is
 * different (OPS-1): the host could have looked and did not finish, so nothing
 * was proven — `unverifiable_timeout` is `usable: false`. It is never cached
 * (it describes this moment) and never counts as a DISPROOF (nothing is retired
 * or clobbered because of it); the require path refuses and names the key.
 *
 * ONLY THE BYTES DISPROVE (OPS-1 review). A pg_restore failure is a disproof —
 * cached in the sidecar, a reason to retire a file — only when its words say the
 * ARCHIVE is damaged (`ARCHIVE_DAMAGE`), or when an unrecognized failure repeats
 * word for word on a second read. A read killed from outside, an I/O error on
 * the backup storage, a pg_restore older than the archive, or a failure that did
 * not repeat is `unverifiable_read_failed`: not a restore point, not a disproof,
 * never cached — the next ask reads again.
