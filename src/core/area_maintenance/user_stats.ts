 * The actor predicate for matrix_activity — the WC-056 indexed EXPRESSION pair,
 * NOT `relation @> …` containment.
 *
 * WHY (2026-07-30, the reported `rebuild_user_stats` statement timeout).
 * Containment can only be answered by the relation GIN, which returns the
 * actor's WHOLE history as one bitmap; a `timestamp` bound is then a Filter, so
 * every window — even a single day — pays for the full actor. Measured on the
 * 32.9M-row mdcat log, actor dd128/2 has 8.1M rows: `count(*)` alone took 57 s
 * against a 60 s `DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`, and the rebuild's row fetch (994 B
 * average width, plus a sort) never came close to finishing. `matrix_activity_
 * who_ts_idx` carries the actor AND `("timestamp", id)`, so the same predicate
 * written as an equality on its expressions turns any window into an index
 * RANGE scan: the identical single-day aggregate is 14 ms.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT is builder_relation's (element 0 is the only actor locator —
 * how activity_log.ts writes it, gated by activity_log_single_actor.test.ts).
 * section_tipo is bound explicitly, so a locator into another section can never
 * be a false positive.
 *
 * (!) DELIBERATE DEVIATION from the containment predicate it replaced: `->>` is
 * type-lossy where `@>` was type-strict, so a NUMERIC section_id matches here and
 * would not have before. That is now LOAD-BEARING, not inert: since
 * WC-2026-08-10-section-id-int-canonical the actor address is minted as an INT
 * (activity_log.ts dd543), while the 32.94M pre-sweep mdcat rows are string-typed
 * — one text extraction spans both, where either typed `@>` probe alone would
 * silently miss half the archive. (It read the opposite before that sweep, when
 * both writers stringified.) jsonb_array_length(dd543) = 1 still holds.

 * byte-identical twins behind. Measured on the oral-history archive: user 2 has
 * 191 duplicated days out of 416, which summed to 41,051 events over a log
 * holding 35,123. Folding both is not a bigger number, it is a wrong one — and
 * it only became visible when the widget started reading the whole history
 * (WC-2026-08-12-user-activity-full-history) instead of the last 365 days.
 * Highest `id` is the most recent run for that day.
 * (The duplicate ROWS are a separate, writer-side defect; this read refuses to
 * report them as activity.)
 *
 * LEDGER — TWO KNOWN-OPEN, UNGATED DEFECTS IN THE `make_date` PREDICATE BELOW
 * (coverage plan §4.4 D15 and D16; the gate
 * test/unit/user_stats_range_native.test.ts deliberately pins NEITHER, because
 * pinning a defect retires it):
 *  - D15 (a.k.a. L3) NARROWING: a stats row stored at YEAR- or MONTH-only
 *    granularity has a NULL month/day, so `make_date` yields NULL, `BETWEEN` is
 *    false, and the row is SILENTLY EXCLUDED. PHP compared the dd1530 virtual
 *    seconds and included it. An undocumented wire divergence: closing it means
 *    either widening the predicate or an engineering/wire_contract/ entry.
 *  - D16 (a.k.a. L2) HARD FAILURE: a MALFORMED stored date (month 0, day 32)
 *    makes `make_date` raise `date field value out of range`, which takes the
 *    ENTIRE query down — the activity widget then 500s for that user forever,
 *    with no per-row fail-soft.
