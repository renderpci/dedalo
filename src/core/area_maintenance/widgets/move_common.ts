 * dd_utils_api:get_process_status); the job's `data` is the report
 * (reportData). THE FAILURE CHANNEL (ERRORS_SPEC §5.3): a run whose report is
 * not ok — a rolled-back file, a run-lock refusal, an UNKNOWN / PARTIAL outcome,
 * a dry run whose executor failed — keeps the report as the job data and ends
 * `error` with the typed `maintenance.action_failed` (its sentence the report's
 * msg + lines), never a `done` frame the client renders as "Process completed".
 * A STOPPED run is not a failure: it ends `stopped`, its report the data.
 *
 * SINGLE-FLIGHT (execute only): a second execute while one is claimed is refused
 * (`resource.conflict`) before any job exists; across processes the engine's
 * per-file run lock refuses it. A dry run takes no claim.
