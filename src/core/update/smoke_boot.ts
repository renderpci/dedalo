/**
 * PRE-FLIGHT SMOKE BOOT (2026-08-23) — boot the QUARANTINE tree once, before
 * the swap, so a release that cannot even start never replaces a working one.
 *
 * The quarantine's own `src/server.ts` is spawned with `DEDALO_SMOKE_BOOT=true`
 * and a throwaway unix socket under the staging dir. Under that flag the
 * server (src/server.ts honours it) SKIPS boot migrations, schedulers,
 * diffusion, watchers and media-tree provisioning — it only binds and answers
 * `/health`. Those skips are convention; the STRUCTURAL guarantee is the env
 * neutralisation at the spawn site below: the child's DEDALO_PRIVATE_DIR,
 * DEDALO_SESSION_DB_PATH and DEDALO_TS_STATE_PATH are repointed at a throwaway
 * dir under the staging dir, so even an import-time writer (session_store.ts)
 * or a future unguarded boot writer cannot touch live state (the one DB touch
 * is /health's SELECT 1 ping against the shared database). The parent polls
 * `/health` over the socket (the `deploy/deploy.sh health_wait` shape), then
 * SIGTERMs and requires a clean exit.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS — what a green smoke boot does NOT prove:
 *  - that the release's BOOT MIGRATIONS succeed: they are deliberately
 *    skipped, because running them pre-swap would mutate the shared database
 *    while the OLD code is still live and serving;
 *  - behaviour under traffic (a single /health round-trip is the whole load).
 * It proves exactly: the tree parses, its module graph evaluates, it binds,
 * and it answers one request — the failure class where a broken release
 * previously took the install down until a manual rollback.
