/**
 * Shared operator preconditions for update/migration EXECUTEs (UPDATE_PROCESS
 * Phase 0) — the PHP update_data_version gate pair (superuser identity +
 * maintenance mode), plus the database-backup verdict: a REFUSAL for a code
 * update (`requireFreshBackup`, waivable), a WARNING for a data migration
 * (`backupWarningsWithin`). PHP does not auto-chain backups before updates and
 * neither do we.
 *
 * A REQUIRED check REFUSES BY THROWING (engineering/ERRORS_SPEC.md §4) — the
 * PHP refusal sentences became the registry messages of `perm.superuser_required`
 * and `maintenance.mode_required`, so this module builds no body and the caller
 * has nothing to forward.
 *
 * ORDER: identity and maintenance mode are SYNCHRONOUS and always asked first
 * (`checkUpdatePreconditions`) on the update EXECUTE paths (the code update and
 * the owned data migration); their backup questions are asked only after, so a
 * non-superuser's update request never starts an archive read. The update
 * PANEL (core/update/status.ts `backup_fresh`) keeps the same rule: it starts no
 * read for a principal who is not the superuser. Gates:
 * test/unit/update_status_native.test.ts and test/unit/code_update.test.ts
 * ("a non-superuser … starts no archive read"). OUT OF SCOPE, by design: the
 * make_backup widget (a global-admin maintenance action whose job IS to dump and
 * read back) and the orphan adoption it starts.

/**
 * THE ONE BACKUP-FRESHNESS VERDICT, shared by the code-update refusal, the
 * update_code panel's `backup_fresh` check (core/update/status.ts) and
 * update_data_version's warnings.
 *
 * It exists because the panel and the refusal had drifted by a ROUNDING STEP
 * (`Math.round(hours) > range` vs the raw fraction) — a deterministic half-hour
 * window, once per backup cycle, in which the panel said "Ready to update" while
 * the pipeline refused. A panel whose whole job is to predict the pipeline's
 * refusals must never compute a refusal a second time.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS NOT USABILITY (audit P0-13, 2026-08-30), AND THE QUESTION IS THE
 * DEEP ONE (OPS-1, 2026-09-30). The age comes from the newest artifact that a
 * FULL `pg_restore` read proved (`newestUsableBackup`). Until 2026-09-30 this
 * path asked the cheap `--list` pass instead, "so the panel would not hang" —
 * and `--list` accepts an archive cut to 60%, so a dump that died part way was a
 * fresh restore point and the unwaived code update swapped the tree over it.
 *
 * THE COST MODEL that makes the deep question affordable (backup.ts, the
 * verification header): the read is ASYNC (the server never freezes),
 * SINGLE-FLIGHT per file and per directory, SERIALIZED (one full read at a time),
 * paid ONCE per artifact (the `.verified` sidecar; our own dumps get theirs at
 * promotion), CAPPED at 3 candidates, and size-BUDGETED. The require path awaits
 * the settled verdict — it runs inside the code update's background job. The
 * HTTP surfaces never await it: they race the SAME shared scan against
 * PANEL_WAIT_MS (`backupFreshnessWithin`) and report `verifying`, never `ok`.
 * Degradations this host cannot do better than (no pg_restore, a foreign
 * format) still count; a read that ran out of time does NOT.
