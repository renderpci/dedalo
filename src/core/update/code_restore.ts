/**
 * Code RESTORE — put a restore point back on the tree (the update, run in
 * reverse). Sibling of code_update.ts, deliberately built out of ITS pieces.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Every update renames the live tree aside into a restore point
 * (`backupDirName`, kept WITH its `node_modules` so a bare `mv` boots with no
 * network). Until now the only human path back was the supervisor's
 * `deploy/dedalo-code-rollback.sh`, which systemd fires by itself and only for
 * a still-PENDING sentinel: an operator whose update SUCCEEDED and who then
 * wants the previous code back had no path but a manual `mv` over ssh. This is
 * that path, from the maintenance panel.
 *
 * MOVE, NEVER COPY. The restore point is CONSUMED by the same atomic rename
 * swap the update uses, and the outgoing tree becomes a NEW restore point —
 * so a restore is itself undoable, and no doubling of a multi-GB tree happens
 * on a disk the update already measured as tight.
 *
 * NOTHING IS RE-IMPLEMENTED. Every gate is the update's own function
 * (`assertSwapPreconditions`, `acquireRunLockOrRefuse` — the SAME lock, so a
 * restore and an update can never interleave —, `prepareStagingDirOrRefuse`,
 * `refuseUntrackedSecrets`, `sentinelGuardedSwap`, `backupDirName`,
 * `installedDigestOf`, `createPhaseTracker`). The one genuinely NEW step is the
 * pre-flight SMOKE BOOT of the restore point (smoke_boot.ts): a backup dir is a
 * tree nobody has executed since the day it was moved aside, and it must be
 * proven to start BEFORE the live tree moves. That is what makes this more than
 * `mv`.
 *
 * THE UPDATE'S SWAP GATES ARE ABOUT THE SWAP, so they belong here too
 * (2026-08-25 review). They lived inside `prepareQuarantine`, which a restore
 * never calls, and the first cut of this module inherited none of them:
 *  - the SECRET WALK (`refuseUntrackedSecrets`). The first rename carries the
 *    WHOLE live tree into the backup dir, so an operator's `certs/`,
 *    `.dedalo.env` or `deploy/*.pem` — absent from a restore point cut before
 *    they existed — would land in the backup and the restored tree would come
 *    up without them. The update refuses exactly this; silence here would have
 *    been the same loss with no message.
 *    NOT the update's ROOT WHITELIST, which the first fix wrongly took with it
 *    (2026-08-26 review). That half reads `shipped` from the tree about to land
 *    and is sound only while that tree is NEWER; here it is OLDER, so every
 *    root entry a later release added read as "unaccounted" and the restore
 *    refused — telling the operator to delete SHIPPED files, on the one path
 *    meant to recover a broken install. The secret walk starts at the root
 *    anyway, so nothing about secrets was lost with it. See its header.
 *  - the HARD BUN PIN. The swap hands the tree to the RUNNING bun, and the
 *    smoke boot spawns `process.execPath`, so a point pinning another Bun can
 *    pass pre-flight and then be started by the supervisor on a runtime its
 *    `node_modules` was never built for. It is a fact of the POINT, so it is
 *    part of `restorabilityOf` rather than a late refusal: the panel disables
 *    that point's button and says why, instead of offering a run that refuses.
 *
 * A RESTORE POINT MAY PREDATE THE SMOKE-BOOT CONTRACT, and then it is NOT
 * booted (2026-08-25 review). `DEDALO_SMOKE_BOOT` landed 2026-08-23; a tree cut
 * before that date ignores the flag and would run its FULL boot — migrations
 * against the shared production database, schedulers, diffusion runners,
 * watchers, media provisioning — as a second live instance, concurrently with
 * the process still serving. The env neutralisation in smoke_boot.ts covers
 * private state, never the shared database. So the pre-flight is CONDITIONAL on
 * the held tree honouring the flag: when it does not, the phase is reported
 * `skipped` (never a false `done`) and the reason is logged. Refusing instead
 * would make the feature useless on precisely the installations that need it —
 * every restore point in existence predates the flag.
 *
 * THE SENTINEL CARRIES THE RESTORE POINT'S OWN DIGEST, read from its
 * `install_stamp.json` — never this process's. After the restart the restored
 * tree confirms the sentinel (boot_confirm.ts); a sentinel naming the digest of
 * the tree we are moving AWAY would make every restore look like a half-applied
 * swap and scream in the log forever. A point with no stamp omits the field, so
 * boot_confirm falls back to its version compare — and when THAT compare cannot
 * separate the two trees either (an unstamped point declaring the running
 * version) the run says so out loud: see `warnOnIndistinguishableSentinel`.
 *
 * THE DATABASE IS NOT RESTORED, and cannot be: migrations already applied stay
 * applied. That hazard is not silently allowed — a restore point declaring a
 * version other than the running one refuses unless the request carries an
 * explicit `confirm_downgrade`, and the waiver is logged loudly (the
 * `waive_backup` idiom).
 *
 * ONE RESTORABILITY PREDICATE. `restorabilityOf` is exported and imported by
 * status.ts: the panel must never compute a verdict the pipeline computes
 * differently (status.ts's header states that law). It answers a MACHINE reason
 * id — the wire carries ids and facts, the sentences live here and in the label
 * catalog.
 *
 * Seam-driven exactly like the update (`targetRoot`/`backupRoot`/`restart`/
 * `smokeBoot`/`supervised`/`channel`/the three renames), so a gate drives the
 * whole pipeline against a TEMP tree.
