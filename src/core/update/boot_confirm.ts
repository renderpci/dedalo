/**
 * BOOT CONFIRMATION of a code update (2026-08-23) — the second half of the
 * sentinel contract that deploy/dedalo-code-rollback.sh reads.
 *
 * code_update.ts writes `<backupRoot>/last_code_update.json` with
 * `status:"pending"` BEFORE restarting. The systemd rollback path
 * (dedalo-ts.service OnFailure / the watchdog) acts on a sentinel that STAYS
 * pending — so the freshly booted tree must flip it to `"confirmed"` once it
 * is demonstrably alive (listener up + first DB ping green). server.ts calls
 * this at exactly that point.
 *
 * A pending sentinel the running tree does NOT match means either a rollback
 * already happened (we are the OLD tree booting again) or a half-applied swap
 * — both log LOUDLY and leave the sentinel untouched (the rollback script owns
 * it in that state). Never throws: confirmation is a post-boot courtesy, and a
 * broken sentinel must not take the server down.
 *
 * WHAT "MATCHES" MEANS (2026-08-24, dev channel): the INSTALLED ARCHIVE DIGEST,
 * not the version. A dev-channel install swaps a tree whose version is
 * unchanged, so a version comparison confirms the rolled-back OLD tree just as
 * happily as the new one — silently disarming the supervisor-side rollback for
 * exactly the class of build (unreleased branch code) most likely to need it.
 * The digest is per-BYTES, so it separates them. Sentinels written before this
 * (no `installDigest`) still fall back to the version compare: an old pending
 * sentinel must not become unconfirmable across the upgrade that introduces
 * the field.
