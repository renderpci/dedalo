/**
 * DISK SPACE for a code update — the gate that was missing on 2026-08-25, when
 * a remote install failed at the `deps` phase with
 *
 *   NoSpaceLeft: failed opening node_modules/… for package @turf/clusters
 *   FileNotFound: failed copying files from cache to destination
 *
 * i.e. the filesystem filled up in the middle of the quarantine's
 * `bun install`. Everything before it (download, verify, extract) had already
 * spent minutes and disk, and the operator was told only "bun install failed".
 *
 * WHAT AN UPDATE ACTUALLY COSTS. The staging dir holds, at peak, the release
 * ZIP + the extracted tree + that tree's OWN node_modules (a full production
 * install — sharp/onnxruntime alone are hundreds of MB). The swap itself is
 * two renames on the same filesystem, so it adds nothing: the backup dir is
 * the old tree, already on disk.
 *
 * So the requirement is the live tree MINUS what the swap never copies:
 * `PRESERVE_ROOT_ENTRIES` (`.git`) is MOVED into the new tree by
 * `carryPreservedEntries`, never staged. Counting it would over-state the
 * requirement by the size of the repository history — measured on a developer
 * checkout, 2.05 GB of a 3.58 GB tree — and a gate that refuses an update
 * that would have succeeded is worse than no gate. node_modules IS counted:
 * the quarantine installs its own. The subtrahend is derived FROM
 * `PRESERVE_ROOT_ENTRIES` itself, never a second list that could drift.
 *
 * `du -sx` (one filesystem, no crossing into mounts) is the measure. It walks
 * ~10^5 inodes, so it belongs on the UPDATE path, which is slow and rare — the
 * readiness panel reports free bytes as a FACT instead (status.ts), the way it
 * reports every other input whose verdict needs the release.
