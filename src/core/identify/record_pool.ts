/**
 * THE BOUNDED RECORD POOL — which records a clustering run is allowed to look at.
 *
 * `match.ts` narrows with the database because it has a SEED to narrow by.
 * Clustering has no seed: "these thirty just came in, what are they?" is a
 * question about a SET. So the pool here is an ordinary search — the caller's
 * own SQO (the import batch's filter, the list the curator is looking at) or,
 * failing that, the sections themselves.
 *
 * THAT IS WHY THE CAP IS NOT OPTIONAL. Clustering compares records with each
 * other, so the work grows with the square of the pool; an unbounded pool is a
 * quadratic pass over a whole collection. The cap is applied HERE, at the one
 * place the pool is produced, and the run is told whether it truncated — a
 * clustering answer computed over the first N of a much larger set is a
 * different claim about the collection than one computed over all of it, and
 * the difference must not be invisible.
 *
 * `truncated` is a FLAG, not a count, for the reason `MatchReport.moreAvailable`
 * gives: the query asks for `cap + 1` rows precisely so it can answer "is there
 * more?" without paying for a count, and reporting that as a number would say
 * "1 more" when there might be five thousand.
 *
 * The principal is REQUIRED here for the same reason it is required in match.ts:
 * `buildSearchSql` treats an absent principal as an INTERNAL unscoped search, so
 * "optional" would mean "see everything" for whoever called this first. This is
 * a SELECT-only module — it enumerates identities and reads no values.
