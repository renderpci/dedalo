/**
 * PREVIEW THUMBNAILS — the picture that goes next to a candidate.
 *
 * Identification is a VISUAL task. The per-criterion breakdown is what makes a
 * score readable, but a curator deciding whether two coins share a die looks at
 * the coins; a ranked list of titles and percentages asks them to take the
 * engine's word for it.
 *
 * WHY THE SERVER RESOLVES THIS. The client cannot: a candidate lives in whatever
 * section the profile covers, and nothing the tool holds says which of that
 * section's media components is "the" photograph. The profile does
 * (`previewComponent`) — it is already the curatorial statement of what this kind
 * of object IS — so the URL is built here, once, next to the record it belongs to.
 *
 * THREE RULES:
 *
 * 1. THE GRAMMAR IS BORROWED, NEVER REBUILT. `mediaThumbLocation` /
 *    `mediaThumbUrl` plus the ontology-driven `resolveMediaPathOptions` are the
 *    media subsystem's own path law (bucket folders, per-section initial path,
 *    the media-root confinement chokepoint). A hand-concatenated path would be a
 *    second, silently divergent copy of it.
 * 2. A URL IS ONLY RETURNED WHEN THE THUMB EXISTS ON DISK. `mediaThumbUrl` is
 *    pure by design and happily names a derivative nobody generated, which
 *    renders as a broken-image icon in every row. Absent thumb → no key in the
 *    map → the client paints a neutral placeholder.
 * 3. ACCESS IS THE CALLER'S ALREADY-DONE WORK, NOT A SECOND PATH. This module
 *    takes records the engine has ALREADY filtered (`match.ts` gates the seed and
 *    every candidate through the per-record scope gate before their values are
 *    read). It performs no read of record data and no ACL decision of its own —
 *    which is deliberate: a thumbnail resolver with its own weaker notion of
 *    "readable" is exactly how a media URL for a hidden record leaks.
 *
 * Reading the URL back is still gated by the web server's media rules (the
 * protection-cookie / publication-marker layer): the engine never serves media
 * bytes, so a thumb URL is a pointer, not an authorization.
