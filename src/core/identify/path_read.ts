/**
 * CRITERION PATH READER — resolve a seed record's value at a criterion path.
 *
 * A criterion is an SQO `path` walked outward from the object section
 * (see ./types.ts). This module is the READ half of identification: given a
 * seed record and that path, it returns what the seed HOLDS there, in the
 * CriterionValue union. `./criteria.ts` then compiles that value plus the
 * criterion into the SQO leaf that finds everybody else holding the same thing.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS FILE OBEYS: it must walk the path exactly the way the
 * SEARCH side walks it, because the two are the halves of one comparison. A
 * reader that disagrees with the matcher is worse than no reader — it produces
 * seeds that cannot find themselves. The hop semantics below mirror the hop
 * semantics of `search/conform.ts` buildJoinChain — its FILTER purpose, the one
 * a criterion compares against. (The chain builder also has an ORDER purpose,
 * which collapses the fan-out to the first stored locator and carries its own
 * alias namespace; a READER has no such collapse, and no line here corresponds
 * to it.) The shared rules:
 *
 *   - the HOP component of step `i` is `path[i-1].component_tipo` and the
 *     section it lands in is `path[i].section_tipo` (the join reads the
 *     PREVIOUS alias's relation key and joins the CURRENT step's table);
 *   - the hop key is the component's DATA tipo (`resolveDataTipo` — WC-020
 *     component_alias: an alias stores nothing under its own tipo);
 *   - the landing row is matched on the LOCATOR's own `section_tipo` +
 *     `section_id`, inside the table of `path[i].section_tipo` — NOT on
 *     `path[i].section_tipo` itself. A multi-target portal whose locator points
 *     at a sibling section sharing that matrix table therefore resolves here
 *     exactly as the SQL LEFT JOIN resolves it, and one pointing at a section
 *     in another table resolves to nothing on both sides;
 *   - every stored locator of a hop is followed (the LATERAL unnest fans out),
 *     so a coin with two Types yields the union of both Types' legends.
 *
 * The LEAF kind comes from the component's model, through the descriptor
 * registry (never a hardcoded model list): the 'relation' column is the
 * relation family, component_date is a range, the 'number' searchBuilder family
 * is numeric, everything else is text.
 *
 * DATES. component_date stores `{start, end}` dd_date OBJECTS in the `date`
 * column, never strings. The ordinal is the persisted virtual-calendar
 * `start.time` — the value `search/builders/builder_date.ts` compares against
 * (`@.start.time <op> …`), stamped on save by `media/file_date.ts`
 * addTimeToDateItem. We READ that stamp first and only recompute with
 * `ddDateToSeconds` when an item was never stamped, precisely to keep reader and
 * matcher on one scale: a stored stamp can be STALE relative to its own
 * year/month/day fields (test3/1 `test145` item 1 carries year 1628 with a
 * year-628 time), and recomputing there would make the record fail to match
 * ITSELF through the search engine. The staleness is a data-integrity question
 * for the save path, not something a reader may paper over.
 *
 * SAFETY. Never throws: an unresolvable path returns null. Refusals that mean
 * "this path is not walkable" (depth cap, non-relation hop, unknown component)
 * WARN before returning null — a silently narrowed read is the failure mode this
 * subsystem cannot afford. Depth is capped at MAX_PATH_HOPS and every
 * (section_tipo, section_id, component_tipo) triple is visited at most once, so
 * a self-referential ontology cannot spin here.
 *
 * REQUEST IDENTITY is a PARAMETER, never an ALS read: the language to resolve
 * values in is passed in (default: the install's main data lang), so this module
 * is callable from a background job with no request scope.
 *
 * ACCESS (P1-3 / SEC-12, 2026-09-03). A criterion path is a FRONTIER CROSSING
 * (security/frontier_scope.ts): every hop reads another record. The walk is
 * authorized HERE, per frontier record, on the record's OWN section — the one
 * it LANDED in, which for a multi-target portal is the LOCATOR's section, not
 * the step's DECLARED one. Before, `component_access.ts criterionReadableOn`
 * authorized the declared leaf while this reader landed wherever the locator
 * pointed: fail-open, and memoized against the declared path. Now:
 *   - the hop component of every frontier record is checked on THAT record's
 *     section before its locators are followed; a landed record is checked by
 *     the RECORD key (the caller's projects scope) before it is read; the leaf
 *     component is checked on each landed record's section before it is quoted;
 *   - the two keys are the frontier's own (`frontierComponentAllowed` with its
 *     engine-minted exemptions — this walk mirrors search's join chain, which
 *     applies the same — and `frontierRecordAllowed`), under
 *     `options.scope`, surface 'door';
 *   - a refusal DROPS that frontier record, loudly (`noteFrontierRefusal`),
 *     and the read continues over the rest: the value simply does not include
 *     what the caller may not read. The caller's DECLARED-leaf pre-check
 *     (criterionReadableOn) stays the source of the `restricted` outcome
 *     marker; a refusal that only appears here reads as absence, which is the
 *     honest limit of a per-record answer that must not count what it hid.
 * A SCOPE IS MANDATORY. An INTERNAL read (a background job, a unit harness)
 * declares itself with {@link internalPathReadScope} — a scope with no
 * principal gates nothing, the posture every caller-less read in this engine
 * takes — but a wiring cannot hand the reader NO scope: the property is
 * required at the type level (tsc, verify.ts step 1) and `readPathValues`
 * REFUSES an absent one at runtime (`internal.invariant`, thrown BEFORE the
 * swallowing try so it is never read as "absent"). Before P1-3 an omitted scope
 * silently meant "internal", so a request-bound wiring that forgot it read
 * ungated — the class the SEC-12 frontier belonged to. The SEED itself is never
 * re-gated here: it is the caller's record, gated at the door that accepted it
 * (match.ts filterAccessible, the API's record scope).
