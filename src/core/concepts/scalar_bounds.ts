/**
 * SCALAR BOUNDS — the ONE declaration of how long a wire scalar may be, and how
 * big the untyped `options` bag may get, at the SINGLE parse door every API
 * request passes through (`server.ts` → `rqoSchema.safeParse`).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (audit 2026-08-26 SEC-21, S2, measured). Nothing in the
 * request contract bounded a string. The login handler reads
 * `String(options.username ?? '')`, the body ceiling is 256 MiB and the shipped
 * nginx configs allow `client_max_body_size 300m`, so ONE UNAUTHENTICATED login
 * POST carrying a 32 MiB username measured 67,109,061 bytes durably written to
 * `matrix_activity` in 3.16 s — inside the database `pg_dump` copies on every
 * backup. A volume defect at an unauthenticated door is a recovery defect.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT AT THE HANDLER. A per-handler clamp is a rule each new door
 * must remember; a bound in the schema is a rule the parse door enforces for
 * every caller, authenticated or not, BEFORE any handler, any log line and any
 * INSERT. An oversize scalar is therefore one uniform `request.invalid_rqo`
 * (WC-2026-09-05-preauth-intake-bounds) — REFUSED, never truncated: silently
 * storing a shortened version of what the caller sent is a lie in an audit trail.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ARE NAMED, NOT SPRINKLED. `test/unit/rqo_scalar_bound_tripwire.test.ts`
 * walks the parsed schema tree and demands every string leaf carry a maximum; it
 * reads the declarations, so raising a ceiling is an edit here and nowhere else.

/**
 * PER-KEY BUDGETS: the keys of `options` whose OWNING HANDLER declares its own,

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A single flat ceiling on the whole bag is a bound that can be
 * SMALLER than the behaviour the engine ships: `options.images[].data_base64` is
 * the only inbound door for assistant/MCP image attachments, and its handler
 * (`src/core/api/handlers/dd_mcp_api.ts`) deliberately accepts up to 8 images,
 * 7,000,000 base64 chars each and 21,000,000 in total — a single ~750 KB
 * photograph would have been refused at the parse door by the 512 KiB bag
 * ceiling and object identification by photo would simply have been dead. The
 * SAME hole existed one door further on and was missed once: `options.image`
 * (SINGULAR) is `dd_identify_api`'s only inbound photograph, capped there at
 * 8 MiB decoded, and every realistic photograph was `request.invalid_rqo`
 * until it earned its budget below.
 *
 * THE LAW: a door's bound may never be tighter than what a handler declares it
 * accepts. So the bag ceiling applies to the UNDECLARED remainder — the open
 * space where the next SEC-21 lives — and each declared key is charged against
 * its own budget, sized ABOVE its handler's own cap (which still runs, and is
 * still the tighter, semantic check: media type, per-image length, entry count).
 * Adding a key here is therefore a deliberate, reasoned widening of ONE key, not
 * of the bag.
 *
 * Gate: `test/unit/rqo_scalar_bound_tripwire.test.ts` asserts every budget is
 * >= the handler constant it exists for, so raising the handler cap without
 * raising the budget is RED rather than a silent refusal in production.
