/**
 * RQO — Request Query Object (spec §3.2). The API request contract.
 *
 * Every client call to the Dédalo API is an RQO: which api class (`dd_api`)
 * and `action` to run, on which target (`source`), optionally with a search
 * (`sqo`) and with `show` / `search` / `choose` blocks whose ddo_maps say
 * which components to resolve and how deep (via ddo `parent` chaining — the
 * heart of the RQO, spec §3.4).
 *
 * PHP references:
 * - canonical keys: class.request_query_object.php:360 ($direct_keys)
 * - entry/dispatch:  core/api/v1/json/index.php → dd_manager::sanitize_client_rqo
 *                    → dd_manager::manage_request → <dd_api>::<action>($rqo)
 *
 * WIRE-CONTRACT NOTE: the user has authorized modernizing the wire contract
 * (the client call layer adapts at the seam). We keep the RQO's conceptual
 * shape and field names — they are the shared vocabulary with the ontology and
 * the copied client — and reserve renames/restructures for deliberate,
 * documented seam decisions, not incidental drift.
