/**
 * THE PUBLICATION-HOST WIRE VOCABULARY — the ONE mapping from an agent answer, or an
 * engine-side refusal about a host, onto the registered `publication_host.*` codes
 * (src/core/errors/registry.ts; phase-3 plan E7; PUBLICATION_HOST_SPEC §2).
 *
 * The agent (publication/host_agent) answers every failure as RFC 9457 problem+json with a
 * stable `type` and, for every refusal it can name, a machine `reason` from a CLOSED list
 * (its src/errors.ts REASON_CODES ∪ RELEASE_REFUSAL_REASONS). This module branches on the
 * HTTP status and that reason — never on prose.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF SENTENCE, the same boundary as tools/tool_sitebuilder/server/wire.ts:
 *  - the agent's `detail` is ANOTHER SERVICE'S prose. It is LOG-ONLY: it goes in the throw's
 *    `message` (capped, flattened to one line) and never into `publicMessage`;
 *  - the sentence a person reads for a refusal is written HERE (AGENT_REASON_SENTENCES for an
 *    agent reason, ENGINE_REASON_SENTENCES for the engine's own) and rides `publicMessage`
 *    only on `publication_host.rejected` (the one public-disclosure code of the family).
 *
 * THE REASON ON THE WIRE. `rejected` and `failed` carry `details.reason` because the client
 * renders the LABEL first (render_api_error.js error_text) and the label says which refusal
 * it was. The value is always a member of DETAIL_REASONS — an agent can never put text of
 * its own in it, and never an engine reason either (agentReason reads the agent table only).
 * Their label has a `${reason}` placeholder, so they are minted ONLY here:
 * agentResponseError, engineFailure, engineRefusal. hostError's type excludes both, and
 * publication_host_wire_native holds the source law (no other file spells either literal;
 * AGENT_ANSWER_CODES is read only by declared classifiers that construct no DedaloError).
 *
 * THE AGENT TABLE IS A TWIN. AGENT_REASON_SENTENCES' key set must EQUAL the agent's closed
 * lists; the gate imports the agent's errors.ts and fails on any difference. The engine
 * table is disjoint from it, by the same gate.
 *
 * A leaf: imports only the error pair. Coordinates (host name, agent status/reason) are
 * LOG-ONLY; no secret ever reaches this module (callers pass names, never tokens).
