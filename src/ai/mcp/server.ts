/**
 * Dédalo MCP server — exposes the ontology-typed read/search core to LLM tools
 * over the Model Context Protocol (REWRITE_SPEC §8, greenfield). This is a THIN
 * transport shell: every tool comes from the shared registry (registry.ts) and
 * delegates to the pure, ACL-gated handlers in tools/*.ts. The server itself
 * holds no business logic and no privilege — it takes ONE service identity at
 * startup (from DEDALO_MCP_USER_ID) and runs every tool call under it, so the
 * MCP surface can never see more than the configured Dédalo user would through
 * the web client.
 *
 * THE IDENTITY IS FIXED; THE GRANTS ARE NOT. `DEDALO_MCP_USER_ID` names the user
 * for the life of the process and no tool can change it — but WHAT that user may
 * do is re-asked on every call (`currentServicePrincipal`), because this process
 * is long-lived and holds no session. A revocation reaches a web client by ending
 * its sessions; there is nothing here to end, so a deactivated, deleted or
 * downgraded service account would otherwise keep its startup grants until an
 * operator happened to restart the server.
 *
 * Run it (stdio transport, the MCP default for a locally-spawned server):
 *   DEDALO_MCP_USER_ID=<dd128 section_id> bun run src/ai/mcp/server.ts
 *   # add DEDALO_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=true to also register the write tools
 *   # optionally DEDALO_MCP_WRITE_SECTIONS=oh1,rsc25 to allowlist writable sections
 *
 * Security posture: the principal is server-authoritative and fixed for the
 * process lifetime; there is no tool to change identity. The server is
 * READ-ONLY unless DEDALO_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=true explicitly registers the write
 * tools (which enforce the same level>=2 permission gate as the human API and
 * audit every change in the Time Machine). A misconfigured or missing
 * DEDALO_MCP_USER_ID is a hard startup error — the server never silently
 * falls back to a privileged identity.
 *
 * WRITE MODE requires a LEAST-PRIVILEGE principal: because the same LLM also
 * reads untrusted, lower-trust record data, a prompt injected into that data
 * could steer a write/delete (a confused deputy). If the write tools ran under
 * an ambient global-admin/superuser they would execute those under full
 * authority. So write mode is REFUSED for a global-admin principal (a hard
 * error) and can be further narrowed to an allowlist of writable sections
 * (DEDALO_MCP_WRITE_SECTIONS). The superuser (-1) is fine for READ-ONLY.

/**

 *
 *   deactivated (dd131 = No)  the login door refuses it; so must this one, or the
 *                             operator's one non-destructive revocation is a no-op here.
 *   deleted (record absent)   the account no longer exists; its grants must not outlive
 *                             it just because a process cached them.
 *   promoted to global admin  the write-mode confused-deputy refusal is enforced at
 *                             BUILD time. A user granted dd244 after startup would slip
 *                             past it, which is the one direction that refusal exists to
 *                             stop, so it is re-checked here too.
 *
 * `resolvePrincipal` is cached and the cache is cleared by the write seam
 * (`clearPrincipalCache`, permissions.ts), so a re-ask normally costs nothing; the dd131
 * read is one indexed row. Returns the refusal rather than throwing: a transport-level
 * crash gives the model nothing it can act on, and `toStructuredErr` is the same
 * converter every other MCP refusal goes through.
 *
 * Exported for its gate: test/unit/account_revocation_native.test.ts drives it against
 * a real deactivated and a real deleted account (GATE-24 — an authorization decision may
 * not rest on a source-substring assertion).
