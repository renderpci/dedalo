/**
 * CLUSTERING — "these thirty are all the same thing", answered once.
 *
 * `findMatches` answers "what else is like THIS record?", one seed at a time. A
 * curator who has just imported two hundred photographs has the other problem:
 * opening two hundred records to confirm the same twelve types is the work the
 * system is supposed to remove. So this module takes a SET of records and
 * returns the groups inside it, each group carrying its members, the member most
 * central to it, what the members agree on, and how much the grouping is worth.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LIVES IN src/ai/identify/ ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it reads the IMAGE INDEX (`ai/rag/object_retrieval.ts`), and the
 * engine's dependency direction is one-way: `src/core/` does not statically
 * import `src/ai/`. `ai/identify/propose.ts` is here for exactly the same reason
 * and combines exactly the same two legs. What is NOT here is anything core owns:
 * the pool query (`core/identify/record_pool.ts`), the criteria matcher
 * (`core/identify/match.ts`), the value reader (`core/identify/path_read.ts`) and
 * the per-component gate (`core/identify/component_access.ts`) are imported, not
 * re-implemented. This module is the composition, nothing else — which is also
 * why it stays inside the directory's static no-write scan
 * (`identify_propose.test.ts`): clustering PROPOSES groups, and a curator's
 * acceptance is an ordinary component save it has no path to.
 *
 * ── THE METHOD, AND WHY A CURATOR CAN ARGUE WITH IT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Threshold-based connected components over a pairwise similarity graph. In
 * full:
 *
 *   1. Each record in the (capped) pool asks for its nearest neighbours, twice:
 *      VISUALLY from the image index, and STRUCTURALLY from the criteria matcher.
 *   2. A neighbour above the relevant threshold becomes an EDGE, tagged with the
 *      signal that produced it and the sentence that explains it.
 *   3. Records joined by edges — directly or through other records — are one
 *      cluster.
 *
 * No library, no centroids, no k to guess, no random seed, no distance metric
 * the answer depends on but nobody can inspect. Every group is a subgraph the
 * result SHIPS: `links` is the literal list of "A and B, 0.94, because their
 * photographs are near-identical", so "why are these together?" is answered by
 * reading the edges, and every member's admission can be traced to a specific
 * pair.
 *
 * THE HONEST COST OF SINGLE LINKAGE is chaining: A~B and B~C put A and C in one
 * cluster even when A and C are not similar at all. That is not hidden, it is
 * MEASURED and reported per cluster — `directEdgeRatio` (what share of the
 * possible pairs are actually linked) and `maxChainHops` (the longest chain
 * inside the group). A cluster with ratio 1.0 and 1 hop is everyone-agrees; a
 * cluster with ratio 0.2 and 5 hops is a chain and reads as one. That is the
 * information a curator needs to decide whether to accept thirty records at
 * once, and a "confidence" number that quietly folded it in would have removed
 * exactly the thing they should be looking at.
 *
 * ── THRESHOLDS: BOTH ALREADY EXIST ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Neither threshold is invented here.
 *  - VISUAL edges use `DEDALO_RAG_NEAR_DUPLICATE_SIMILARITY` (default 0.93), the
 *    floor the RAG layer already means by "these two pictures are the same
 *    thing" — reused through `multimodalConfigFromEnv()` so an institution that
 *    tuned it gets the tuning here too.
 *  - CRITERIA edges use the profile's OWN `thresholds.sameType`, which is the
 *    curator's authored statement of "this score means same type". Inventing a
 *    second number for the same judgement would be a way for the tool to
 *    disagree with the profile it is running.
 * Both are overridable per call, and both are echoed in the report, because a
 * grouping is meaningless without the threshold that produced it. A run spanning
 * SEVERAL sections applies each section's own authored floor, so the criteria
 * side is echoed per section (`thresholds.criteriaBySection`) and the scalar
 * `thresholds.criteria` collapses only when there is genuinely one number.
 *
 * ── ACCESS CONTROL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The principal is REQUIRED, for the reason `match.ts` states at length. A
 * record the caller may not read must not APPEAR in a cluster and must not
 * INFLUENCE one — the second half matters as much as the first, because a hidden
 * record that bridges two groups would silently merge them and change the answer
 * a curator acts on. So the gate runs before any edge exists: the pool is
 * scoped, and `buildClusterGroups` then discards any edge whose endpoints are
 * not both in the scoped node set (mechanically, not by trusting the callers).
 * Values are additionally re-gated per (section, component) before they are
 * quoted in a consensus line.
 *
 * ── BOUNDED, AND HONEST ABOUT IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pool is capped (`core/identify/record_pool.ts`) and the report says when
 * the cap truncated the run. Cancellation is cooperative: the caller's
 * `AbortSignal` is checked at every record boundary, and an aborted run returns
 * the clusters it had found with `stopped: true` rather than nothing at all.
