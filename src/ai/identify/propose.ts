/**
 * ELEMENT PROPOSALS — the no-model tier of "AI proposes, human confirms".
 *
 * Given a record whose identification criteria are only half filled in, propose
 * what the missing ones probably hold, by a SIMILARITY-WEIGHTED VOTE over the
 * neighbours that are ALREADY TAGGED. No model, no egress, no training: the
 * only knowledge used is what curators already recorded, which is why every
 * proposal can name the records it came from and a curator can check it in one
 * click. Vision and OCR land later (IDENTIFY_SPEC §9) and feed the SAME
 * acceptance flow — they are additional sources of votes, not a different
 * pipeline.
 *
 * ── THIS MODULE NEVER WRITES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here saves, enqueues, or mutates anything: it returns data. That is
 * the project's first identification invariant ("no model-written data" —
 * IDENTIFY_PLAN §7.1), and it is meant to be STRUCTURALLY true rather than a
 * convention someone remembers. Concretely: this file imports no write module
 * (no `db/matrix_write`, no `section/record/*`, no `relations/save`, no queue),
 * issues no SQL of its own, and every value it produces is a plain object handed
 * back to the caller. `identify_propose.test.ts` asserts that mechanically, so a
 * future edit that adds a write seam fails the gate rather than shipping.
 * Acceptance is a separate, curator-initiated action through the normal
 * TM-audited component save path.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS THE CHARACTERIZER, GENERALISED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ai/rag/characterizer.ts` already does this exact algorithm — retrieve
 * neighbours, read a value per neighbour, vote weighted by similarity, cite the
 * evidence — but only over the fixed `rag.context.metadata` roles (typology,
 * period, material). Identification's vocabulary is the PROFILE's criteria, and
 * a criterion is an SQO path rather than a component tipo, so the retrieval and
 * the aggregation are reused verbatim (`aggregateCategorical`, `summarizeDates`)
 * and only the READ side changes: `identify/path_read.ts` instead of a role
 * reader. Writing a third voting implementation would guarantee three
 * confidences that disagree.
 *
 * Two adaptations happen at that boundary, deliberately:
 *  1. The aggregators vote over STRINGS. A criterion value is a locator, a
 *     number or a date range, so each neighbour value is projected to a VOTE KEY
 *     (a locator's identity key, a normalized text, a tolerance bucket) and the
 *     winning key is mapped back to the structured value a curator can accept.
 *     The proposal therefore carries both: a display string and the
 *     `CriterionValue` the confirm flow will save.
 *  2. `summarizeDates` reports labels, not ordinals. The earliest/latest ordinal
 *     range is computed here alongside it, from the same items, so an accepted
 *     date proposal has something to write and not just something to read.
 *
 * ── WHERE NEIGHBOURS COME FROM, AND WHY IT IS ALWAYS REPORTED ────────────────
 *
 * Visual neighbours (`ai/rag/object_retrieval.ts`) when the section declares an
 * image index; otherwise STRUCTURAL neighbours — records that agree on the
 * criteria the seed DOES record, found by the ordinary matcher
 * (`core/identify/match.ts` findMatches). The two answer very different
 * questions ("looks like this" vs "is catalogued like this"), so which one ran
 * is part of the result and carries its reason. A structural fallback that
 * looked like a visual result would quietly turn "we have no photograph of this"
 * into a confident-looking visual claim.
 *
 * ── ACCESS CONTROL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The principal is REQUIRED, for the reason match.ts states at length: an absent
 * principal means "unscoped" downstream, and a proposal QUOTES its neighbours'
 * values back. A neighbour the caller cannot read must never contribute a vote
 * and never appear as evidence — that is an information leak, not a permissions
 * nicety. Three gates, in this order:
 *   - the SEED is checked first and a denied seed RAISES (match.ts's
 *     IdentifyAccessError, reused: same question, same answer);
 *   - every neighbour passes the per-RECORD scope gate BEFORE any value of it is
 *     read (the retrieval legs gate too; this is not redundant, it is the gate
 *     that does not depend on which leg ran);
 *   - every criterion is re-gated per COMPONENT on that neighbour
 *     (`getPermissions`, the characterizer's M3 rule): dd774 grants are
 *     per-(section, component), and the record grant says nothing about the
 *     component this criterion actually reads.
 * Denied neighbours are dropped SILENTLY — a "3 hidden" count is an existence
 * oracle.
 *
 * REQUEST IDENTITY IS A PARAMETER, never an ALS read (isolation rule 2/6): the
 * principal and the data lang are passed in, so this is callable from a
 * background job. No module-level state of any kind lives here.
