/**
 * Dédalo TS server — HTTP entry point.
 *
 * Bun.serve on a UNIX SOCKET only: the reverse proxy (Apache/Nginx) owns TCP,
 * serves static files/media, and forwards API traffic here (spec §4; same
 * pattern as the production diffusion engine).
 *
 * PERSISTENT-RUNTIME DISCIPLINE (spec §4, plan risk A5.1): every request gets
 * its own RequestContext created HERE and threaded explicitly through all
 * resolution code. Nothing request-dependent may live at module level. The
 * context object is the one place request identity exists.
 *
 * Routes:
 * - /health (liveness);
 * - /api/v1/json + /dedalo/core/api/v1/json[/] (parse → zod-validate →
 *   dispatch; auth/CSRF/allowlist gates live in core/api/dispatch.ts). The
 *   /dedalo alias is the path the COPIED CLIENT computes relatively from its
 *   page URL (data_manager fallback '../api/v1/json/');
 * - GET /dedalo/* — the copied client static assets (Phase 7 seam), served
 *   from client/dedalo/ at the SAME paths the PHP deployment uses so the
 *   client's relative references need no edits;
 * - GET /, /dedalo[/], /dedalo/core[/] — 302 to the app entry point
 *   (ENTRY_REDIRECT_PATHS; the PHP index.php shims).

 * is the fallback for the one case where no web server is in the path at all: a
 * developer hitting the TCP dev listener directly. Without it a fresh install
 * following docs/install/dev_quickstart.md 404s every image, video and PDF — which
 * is what happened, because the flag below is off by default and the quickstart
 * never mentions it.
 *
 * Rather than a flag an operator must remember, the fallback is bound to conditions
 * that CANNOT hold in production, so MEDIA-04 ("never in production") is structural:
 *
 *  1. PROTECTION WINS, ALWAYS — and no flag can override this. Once an admin sets
 *     private/publication the generated web-server rules are authoritative: the engine
 *     must never serve the same bytes with weaker checks (session-only, no per-record
 *     ACL). Letting MEDIA_DEV_ROUTE_ENABLED=true punch through would (a) hand a logged-in
 *     session every master file the markers were gating and (b) BREAK rule B, because an
 *     anonymous visitor of a published record carries no session and would get a 404 from
 *     here instead of the file the marker says is public. A stale `true` copied between
 *     .env files must not be able to do that.
 *  2. Dev TCP listener only. Production is socket-only (SERVER_TCP_PORT is unset there —
 *     docs/install/production.md), so the fallback does not exist for it.
 *
 * MEDIA_DEV_ROUTE_ENABLED therefore only moves the needle while protection is UNCONFIGURED:
 * 'true' forces the fallback on for every listener (loud boot warning — it reaches the
 * socket), 'false' forces it off even in dev. With protection configured it is inert.

 * `test/unit/api_gzip_native.test.ts`, whose central assertion is that what the
 * client parses after decompression equals what the plain door would have sent.
 *
 * A section EDIT read is ~297 KB of JSON and 92.7% of it is compressible
 * redundancy (25.7% is exact-duplicate field values — the repeated `tools`
 * block alone is 39,738 B across 46 of 81 context entries). Measured on the
 * numisdata3/1 edit payload: level 1 → 31,831 B in 1.1 ms (10.7% of the
 * original); level 9 → 21,734 B but costs several times the CPU. Level 1 is
 * the right default — it buys 89% of the level-9 win for ~1 ms.
 *
 * This is a TRANSPORT concern, so it lives here next to the cookie policy and
 * not in api/response.ts, which owns the envelope. The JSON bytes are
 * unchanged, so there is no wire-shape divergence — only Content-Encoding.
 *
 * `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is emitted whenever we compress: authenticated
 * payloads already carry `Cache-Control: no-store`, but unauthenticated ones do
 * not, and an intermediary that cached a gzipped body without Vary would serve
 * it to a client that never asked for gzip.
 *
 * WHY COMPRESSING AN AUTHENTICATED BODY IS SAFE HERE (BREACH). Every response
 * carries `csrf_token` (dispatch.ts appends it for client transparency), and
 * compressing a secret alongside attacker-influenced text is the BREACH shape.
 * It is not reachable on this door, and the load-bearing reason is the COOKIE,
 * not the origin list. BREACH needs the victim's browser to issue many
 * cross-origin requests that come back carrying the VICTIM'S secret; the
 * session cookie is `SameSite=Lax` (see sessionCookieHeader), so it never rides
 * a cross-site POST however the calling page asks for it. A cross-origin
 * response is therefore an ANONYMOUS one: it holds no session of the victim's
 * to compress a token against. `verifyCsrf` (dispatch.ts) and the CORS
 * allowlist (security/cors.ts) narrow the door further, but they are not what
 * closes it — an operator running a PUBLIC ontology master sets
 * `DEDALO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["*"]` and the analysis above still holds. If
 * the session cookie's SameSite posture is ever relaxed, or a cross-origin
 * response is ever allowed to carry credentials, REVISIT THIS.

 * MEDIA-03 (refined — SECURITY_DECISIONS.md DECISION 2): the safety headers for

 *
 *  - Server-generated image ENVELOPES (image/&#42;&#42;/svg/&#42;.svg — written only by
 *    svg_overlay's fixed template; 'svg' is not an image quality and
 *    component_image rejects .svg uploads, so no uploader bytes reach this
 *    path). The client renders them INLINE via <object type="image/svg+xml">
 *    and needs same-origin contentDocument access (quality switch, vector
 *    editor) plus the same-origin raster <image> fetch — attachment/sandbox
 *    breaks all of that (blank image). Script is blocked by CSP instead.
 *  - Every other SVG (raw svg/ uploads) stays download-only + sandboxed:
 *    the client only uses them as <img src>, which ignores the disposition.
 *
 * Split out of the route body and exported so the SELECTION is gated without a
 * media corpus: the route-level MEDIA-03 cases need a real .svg on disk and skip
 * silently on a fresh install or the hermetic CI tier — and since XSS-02's
 * `object-src` admits the envelope folder (core/api/static_asset.ts), a rotted
 * selection here is no longer backstopped by the app CSP.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this is the Bun dev/fallback media route only. In the documented
 * production topology the web server serves media from the generated access
 * rules (core/media/protection.ts), which emit access control and NO headers —
 * so these guarantees do not hold there. Ledgered, not implied.

 * import cycles then poisons the failed module for the entire process life
 * (Bun caches failed evaluations — observed 2026-07-07: 1114 identical
 * `dd_core_api::read` failures until restart, undetectable by the DB-only

		// variable-numbered stats entries are DROPPED and recreated NULL. The
		// FIXED-numbered views are reset in place WITH a timestamp, so
		// `pg_stat_bgwriter.stats_reset >= pg_postmaster_start_time()` means the
		// cumulative counters were discarded at or after this boot. That is exact,
		// unlike the per-table inference in `summarizeStatisticsHealth`, which is a
		// heuristic over current state. Two known limits, both deliberate: it stays
		// TRUE for the whole postmaster lifetime (it is provenance, never "repair
		// owed"), and it is blind to a restore into a fresh cluster (counters zero,
		// flag FALSE) — which is precisely the case the per-table verdict catches.
