/**
 * THE RECORD FIELD SET — what ONE record request asks the service for
 * (2026-09-24, WC-2026-09-24-external-record-field-set).
 *
 * A remote record is fetched ONCE per (service, section, remote id, lang), with
 * the UNION of the remote fields mapped by EVERY component_external of the
 * owning section, PLUS the field that carries the row's own id (the model's
 * `remoteIdPath`, default `id`). Every component then projects its own fields
 * from that one row (fields_map.ts mapRowToEntries).
 *
 * WHY, measured live against Zenon on 2026-09-24. Each component used to ask for
 * ITS OWN fields only (`field[]=title`). A service that answers only the fields
 * it is asked for (Zenon does) then returned a row WITHOUT `id`, so the identity
 * check (fields_map.ts defaultPickRow — the row's id must equal the requested
 * one) refused it, and every non-id column read `not_found`. And the per-component
 * field sets split one record into one request (and one cache entry) PER
 * COMPONENT — four GETs per Zenon record. v6 asked once per record with all of
 * the section's mapped fields; this restores that, keeping the identity check.
 *
 * THE UNION IS SECTION-WIDE, NOT CALLER-WIDE. It is computed here, from the
 * ontology, and applied inside the one row layer (cache.ts fetchExternalRows)
 * — so the cache key's field signature is the same for every caller (a cell's
 * own fallback fetch, the portal prepass, the export batch prefetch) and they
 * share one cache entry per record by construction, whatever each predicted.
 *
 * WHICH COMPONENTS. The component_external nodes of the section's own subtree
 * and of its REAL section's (a virtual section borrows its real section's
 * children — the ownership rule of component_external/value.ts), without
 * crossing into a nested section or area (getOrderedSubtree's containment
 * rule). A component whose fields_map is malformed contributes nothing here: its
 * OWN derivation reports it `misconfigured`, and one cataloguing error must not
 * take the whole section's record fetch down with it. NOR does a field the
 * ADAPTER refuses (`acceptsRemoteField` — Zenon splices names into the URL and
 * takes bare identifiers only: `dc:title`, `publication-dates`). A parseable map
 * naming one used to enter the union, so `buildRecordRequest` refused EVERY
 * record request of the section (bad_config → each column of each record
 * `unavailable`, retryable, the wrong cause); now the name is left out, here
 * and from a caller's own fields, and only the component that maps it is
 * `misconfigured` (component_external/value.ts checks the same predicate).
 *
 * ORDER (it is part of the URL): the id field first, then the other fields in
 * ontology sibling order, deduped. Deterministic for a given ontology, so the
 * request bytes are stable.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE: `createOntologyCache` — the set is ontology-derived (fields_map
 * edits, added/removed components), so an ontology write drops it, exactly like
 * the row cache whose key it feeds, and like config.ts's binding cache (the
 * same lifecycle, same exposure: src/external may not import the db layer —
 * external_write_refusal_tripwire — so it cannot ask isInTransaction(); no
 * record read runs inside an ontology-write transaction, and the hub's
 * post-COMMIT clear drops whatever an in-flight read memoized).
