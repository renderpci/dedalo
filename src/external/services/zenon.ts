/**
 * ZENON — the DAI (Deutsches Archäologisches Institut) bibliographic catalogue.
 *
 * The one adapter that exists today, and the worked example services/README.md
 * points at. It is DATA plus pure functions: no socket, no config read, no DB.
 *
 * REQUEST FORM. Reproduced from the FROZEN v7 PHP
 * (v7_php_frozen/…/core/component_external/entities/class.zenon.php), which had
 * already diverged from v6:
 *
 *     <api_url>?id=<id>&lgn=<alpha2>[&field[]=<f>…]
 *
 * with `lgn` defaulting to `en` when the Dédalo lang code has no ISO 639-1
 * mapping (v6 emitted an empty `&lgn=&`), and the field segment OMITTED
 * ENTIRELY when no fields are requested (no dangling `&`). The literal
 * `field[]=` is why this is assembled as a string rather than through
 * URLSearchParams, which would percent-encode the brackets and change the
 * bytes. Injection is closed at the source instead: the id must match the
 * declared `numeric_string` shape and every field name must be a bare
 * identifier, both refused loudly before they reach the string.
 *
 * IDs are zero-padded strings ("001338683"). The codec is the identity, and
 * that is the whole point — parsing one as a number would silently rewrite the
 * locator of every record in the section.
 *
 * SEARCH REQUEST FORM (implemented 2026-08-06,
 * `WC-2026-08-06-external-search-request`). Reproduced from the browser engine
 * that used to issue it directly — VuFind's search API, POST with the query in
 * the QUERY STRING and no body:
 *
 *     POST <api_url_search>?lookfor=<q>&type=AllFields&sort=relevance
 *          &limit=<n>[&page=<p>]&prettyPrint=false&lng=<alpha2>[&field[]=<f>…]
 *
 * Three things the browser did are carried over but made honest:
 *
 *  - `lng` was the hard-coded literal `de`. It is now derived from the REQUEST's
 *    data lang through the same alpha-2 helper and the same `en` default as the
 *    record path, so a Spanish cataloguer stops getting German labels.
 *  - the EMPTY-QUERY SENTINEL (a seven-enye nonsense literal) is GONE. It existed because
 *    Zenon answers an empty `lookfor` with its first ten records; a magic string
 *    that only works while a remote's tokeniser keeps failing to match it is not
 *    a contract. An empty query is refused here (and, before any socket, by the
 *    facade, which answers an empty result).
 *  - `limit` was frozen at 20. It comes from the caller now; `offset` too, via
 *    VuFind's 1-based `page`. An offset that is not a whole number of pages is
 *    REFUSED rather than rounded — VuFind cannot express it, and answering a
 *    neighbouring window is a wrong answer that looks right.
 *
 * As on the record path, the literal `field[]=` is why the query string is
 * assembled by hand; every VALUE is percent-encoded and every field name must be
 * a bare identifier.
