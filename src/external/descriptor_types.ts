/**
 * EXTERNAL SERVICE MODEL — the descriptor every external record service is

 *
 * Shape law (mirrors src/core/components/types.ts ComponentModel): an adapter
 * is DATA plus a handful of pure functions. It never opens a socket, never
 * reads config, never touches the DB — transport.ts owns the one outbound
 * door, config.ts owns the ontology-derived settings, cache.ts owns the
 * lifetimes. That is what makes "add a service" one file in services/ plus one
 * registry line, with no engine edit (services/README.md is the checklist).
 *
 * Everything optional here has a DEFAULT implemented in fields_map.ts
 * (extraction, row unwrapping, row picking, id codec). The defaults are the
 * general case — a flat top-level payload with an `id` key is the degenerate
 * one — so a nested-payload, opaque-id service (Wikidata `Q42` +
 * `labels.en.value`) is mappable by a cataloguer through fields_map alone.

 *    remote FIELD NAMES. Note that the id set is ITSELF a disclosure: it tells

 *    they are being consulted.
 *  - `query_terms`  — free text a cataloguer typed (a search box).
