		doc: `Origins allowed to call this server's JSON API from a **browser** on another origin.

Empty (the default) means **no CORS headers are sent at all** and the browser blocks every
cross-origin call — the safe default, and the behaviour of every install that does not set this.

The one workflow that needs it is a Dédalo acting as an **ontology master**
(\`IS_AN_ONTOLOGY_SERVER=true\`): the update panel on the *client* Dédalo fetches
\`get_ontology_update_info\` from the master **directly from the browser**
(\`client/dedalo/core/area_maintenance/widgets/update_ontology/js/render_update_ontology.js\`),
so the master must name the client origins here. The server-to-server probe
(\`checkRemoteServer\`) is unaffected — it is a Bun \`fetch\`, and CORS is a browser rule.

An entry is matched as an **exact, case-sensitive origin string** — scheme + host + port, no
path, no trailing slash, no partial wildcards. \`https://a.example.org\` does not match
\`https://a.example.org:443\` or \`http://a.example.org\`.

Only a listed origin is echoed back in \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\`; \`*\` is never sent on
the wire, and neither is \`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\` — the client calls cross-origin
with \`credentials: 'same-origin'\` (\`data_manager.js\`), and the session cookie is
\`SameSite=Lax\`, so no cookie ever rides one of these requests whatever the calling page asks
for. A cross-origin caller is therefore ALWAYS unauthenticated and reaches only what the
API opens to an anonymous request; listing an origin does not grant it a session.

\`\`\`bash
DEDALO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://archive.example.org","https://museum.example.org"]
\`\`\`

**A PUBLIC ontology master sets the single entry \`*\`, meaning any origin.** It is the only
way to express a master that serves its manifest to installations you do not know in advance:
that set of client origins is unbounded, so it cannot be enumerated. \`*\` is a whole-list
sentinel, not a pattern — it simply wins over any other entry, and there is no
\`*.example.org\` form, because a suffix rule is the classic CORS bypass. The request origin
is still what gets echoed back, so \`Vary: Origin\` keeps meaning what it says.

What \`*\` changes is **who may ASK**: from "any HTTP client" — already true today, since CORS
is a browser rule and not a firewall — to "any HTTP client, plus any web page in a visitor's
browser". The surface it opens is the anonymous one \`curl\` already reaches: the update
manifest and the reachability probe (still behind the \`ONTOLOGY_SERVER_CODE\` access code
every client presents), plus login and password reset, which are throttled per client address
(\`LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS\`) — note that a page running in a visitor's browser spends the
VISITOR's address against that throttle. Nothing authenticated is reachable either way, on
any setting. Use \`*\` on a deliberately public master; on an ordinary installation, name the
origins.

**The default is fail-closed, and that is deliberate.** Until 2026-08-24 an install that

identically, while \`'private'\` would later 404 the archive's own published site the day
diffusion writes its first marker.

serves an open media tree said so. What is no longer honoured is silence.

It is deliberately much higher than \`LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS\` (default \`50\` against \`10\`),
