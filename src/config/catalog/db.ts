Setting it — \`30000\` is a sensible production value — turns pool exhaustion from a
silent, indefinite hang into a loud, diagnosable answer: the request fails with the error
\`db.pool_exhausted\` (HTTP 503, "try again in a moment"). It does not make the server
slower: it only bounds how long it is willing to be stuck. Every way of taking a
connection counts against the pool — a query, a transaction, a connection reserved for
one caller — so nothing can exhaust the pool behind this bound's back. The maintenance
pool (\`DB_MAINTENANCE_POOL_MAX\`) has its own connections and applies the same bound to
them.

minimum \`1\`.

The limit is **per process**, and a Dédalo installation runs more than one: the server
itself, plus one process per concurrent publication runner
(\`DEDALO_DIFFUSION_MAX_RUNNERS\`), plus background workers. Each process may also open
up to \`DB_MAINTENANCE_POOL_MAX\` maintenance connections. All of them together must
stay below the PostgreSQL server's own \`max_connections\` (typically 100). With the
defaults — a server and two runners — the installation uses at most 36 connections,
which leaves ample room. Raise this only when the database server has the connections
to spare.

A publication runner needs at least **2**: each batch holds one connection for its whole
write to the publication target, and the runner's heartbeat needs another beside it. A
runner started with \`DB_POOL_MAX=1\` refuses to start, naming this key.

maintenance-area actions that scale with the size of the data (store rebuilds, VACUUM and
REINDEX, bulk transforms, imports), the data-update engine and the other deliberately
long operations. The other maintenance-area actions stay on the request pool, so they
never queue behind a long one. Default \`2\`, minimum \`1\` (a \`0\` is read as \`1\`).

These connections are separate from the request pool (\`DB_POOL_MAX\`) for one reason:
they carry no statement ceiling (\`DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS\` does not apply to them), and
keeping them apart means the request pool's ceiling is never lifted on a connection a
request could later be handed. The pool is opened only when maintenance work first
runs, and its idle connections close after 30 seconds.

Count these connections in the installation's budget TWICE: every process may hold up
to \`DB_POOL_MAX + 2 × DB_MAINTENANCE_POOL_MAX + 2\` connections (16 with the defaults).
The index-rebuild lane (REINDEX/VACUUM) is a second set of these connections that keeps
its own idle ones for 30 seconds, and a stop or an update verdict opens up to 2
short-lived connections of its own. All processes together (the server, each diffusion
runner) must stay below the PostgreSQL server's \`max_connections\`.

own \`sslmode\` vocabulary: \`disable\` (the default), \`allow\`, \`prefer\`, \`require\`,
\`verify-ca\` or \`verify-full\`.

**Why this key exists at all.** Bun 1.4 began honouring the ambient \`PGSSLMODE\` /
\`PG_SSLMODE\` environment variables inside \`Bun.sql\` (Bun 1.3 ignored them). Those are
set on plenty of machines for \`psql\`/\`pg_dump\`, so without an explicit value here the
engine's own TLS mode would be decided by whatever the surrounding shell, systemd unit
or CI image happened to export — an input the typed config catalog cannot see and the
operator has nothing to correct in \`../private/.env\`. Dédalo therefore always passes
this value explicitly, and the ambient variables can never apply.

The default \`disable\` preserves the behaviour every installation had before Bun 1.4.
A typical install talks to PostgreSQL over a unix socket or localhost, where TLS buys
nothing. Set \`require\` (or a verifying mode) when the database lives on another host.

DB_SSLMODE=disable

	DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS: {
		type: 'number',

		heading: 'Database statement timeout',

		doc: `The maximum time (in milliseconds) any single database statement of ordinary request
traffic may run before PostgreSQL cancels it. The default \`0\` means no limit.

**A production installation should set it** — \`60000\` (one minute) is the recommended
value: one runaway query must not be able to occupy a connection forever and starve
every other user. It is also the only bound on a search that cannot stop early: some
columns are deliberately left unindexed, and a term that matches nothing there reads
the whole table — on a large activity log that is minutes, and a user closing the
browser does NOT cancel it. A statement stopped by this ceiling answers with the error
\`db.statement_timeout\` (HTTP 503), never a generic server error.

Long-running MAINTENANCE does not run under this ceiling, so it does not have to be
sized around it: the maintenance-area actions (reindex, vacuum, search-store rebuilds,
the bulk transforms) and the data-update engine run on a separate maintenance connection
pool whose statements are unbounded (\`DB_MAINTENANCE_POOL_MAX\`), and the boot
migrations lift the ceiling for their own transaction. Not yet exempt, so measure them
on your installation before setting a value: the search-store builds a boot runs when
it finds a store missing or damaged, the observer mirror reconcile
(\`scripts/observer_reconcile.ts\`) and the activity-log retention prune on a very large
log. Choose a value comfortably above your slowest legitimate *request* — if searches
or exports on very large sections are part of daily work, measure them first (see
\`DEDALO_SLOW_QUERY_MS\`).
