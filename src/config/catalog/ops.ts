Making the backups is the operating system's job — a nightly timer, described under
[Backups](../management/backup.md). What this value decides, verified against the code on
2026-08-30, is:

- **Whether a code update may proceed.** Applying a code release is REFUSED when the newest
  dump in the backup directory is older than this many hours, or when there is none at all:
  a code swap's rollback contract leans on there being a database to come back to. The
  operator can waive the refusal explicitly, and the update panel shows the same verdict
  before they start.
- **Whether the maintenance "Make backup" button would skip.** It never does today: that
  button always forces a dump, so the throttle it belongs to is not reached.

Age is judged by the newest backup file's modification time. Keep the value in step with how
often the nightly job actually runs — set it below the real interval and the updater refuses
on an installation that is backing up perfectly well.

An export runs on the server as a background job: it walks every selected record, writes the
result to a working copy in this directory, and builds each download (CSV, TSV, HTML, XLSX, ODS,
the lossless NDJSON and the media ZIP) from that copy. Each user has a subdirectory of their own
and each export one more below it; only the user who ran an export can download its files.

Unset, the files go to \`export_artifacts\` inside the private directory. Point it at another
volume when exports are large: a full export of a big collection with many columns can take
gigabytes while it exists, and it is only ever temporary (see
\`DEDALO_EXPORT_ARTIFACTS_TTL_HOURS\`). The directory must be writable by the user the engine
runs as and must NEVER sit inside a tree the web server publishes — an export is a copy of your
records, and it is served only through the engine, after the owner and their read access have
been checked again. The engine enforces this: a directory that is, sits inside, or contains the
media directory, the client files or a tool directory (the in-repo tools and every
\`DEDALO_ADDITIONAL_TOOLS\` path — the engine serves those without a login) (symbolic links followed)
is refused, and no export is written until it is moved; the refusal is logged at start-up.

Give it a directory of its own, empty or not yet created. The engine deletes expired exports
here every hour, so it only works in a directory it owns: on first use it leaves a
\`.dedalo_export_artifacts\` marker file in an empty directory. A directory that already
holds other files and has no marker is refused, and nothing in it is written or deleted.

Each installation needs its OWN directory. The marker records which installation claimed it
(a fingerprint of its database), and a directory another installation's marker names is
refused by every door — listing, preview, download, sweep — so two instances that copied the
same example path never see or delete each other's exports.
