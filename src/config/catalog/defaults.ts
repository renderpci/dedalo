    The old name did not describe the value: this is the set of ontology
    **top-level domains** active in the installation. The old spelling is retired —
    if it is still in your \`.env\` the server refuses to boot and names the line to
    change.

This parameter defines the ontology TLDs to be used in the Dédalo installation.

Every tipo (typology of indirect programming object) defines a heritage field, a data model, a structuring tools and definitions. Dédalo is a multi heritage application with ontologies for Archeology, Ethnology, Oral History, Numismatics, etc. Every project or institution can add any tipos that it demands. An archaeologic museum will use the model for archeological catalogs, but it will not need the ethnological definitions. In the same way that Oral History project will don't use the archeological or numismatic definitions.

Every installation carries the **core** ontologies — they ship in the install database itself:

| **TLD** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **dd** | Dédalo. Definition of default list and common uses and tools such as translation tools. |
| **rsc** | Resources. Definition for areas and sections commons to all projects such as people, images, audiovisual files, publications, documents, bibliography, etc. |
| **ontology** | Ontology. Definition of the sections used as nodes of the ontology |
| **ontologytype** | Ontology typologies. The typologies the ontology registry groups the ontologies by. |
| **hierarchy** | Thesaurus. Definition for sections as toponymy, onomastic, chronologies, techniques, material, etc. |
| **lg** | Languages, Definition for the languages in the thesaurus (used for all application to translate data and interface) |

Besides, every installation chooses the **domain** ontologies it uses in its inventory or research — at install time (the installer installs at least one; \`oh\` is the default) or later, from the ontology update panel:

| **TLD** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **oh** | Oral History, the definition sections and tools to be used for oral history projects such as interviews, transcription, indexation, etc. |
| **ich** | Intangible Cultural Heritage, the definition sections and tools to use for intangible heritage, such as elements, processes, communities, symbolic acts, etc. |
| **tch** | Tangible heritage, the definition of sections and tools to use for tangible heritage, such as objects, collectors, informants, etc |
| **tchi** | Tangible heritage immovable, the definition of sections and tools to use for tangible heritage immovable, such as archeological sites, finds, alqueries, etc |
| **dmm** | Memory and documentary heritage, the definition of sections and tools to be used for the heritage of memory, such as graves, deportees, exiles, tortured, etc. |
| **numisdata** | Numismatic heritage, the definition sections and tools to use for numismatics project, such as mints, types, legends, hoards, finds, etc. |
| **isad** | Archives following the [ISAD(g) standard](https://www.ica.org/en/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition) (General International Standard Archival Description - Second edition), the definition of sections and tools to be used for cataloging documents with the standard structure, etc. |
| **actv** | Activities, the definition of section and fields of activities as exhibitions, workshops, didactics, conferences, etc. |
| **utoponymy** | Unofficial toponymy. Section definition for unofficial toponymy (unofficial places names), used to add places that are not inside the official toponymy of countries or the installation don't want import the official toponymy (use to point the place without the official term in some sections as Publications, to define any place of publication around the world) |
| **nexus** | Nexus, a standalone module with its own sections. |

The installer WRITES this key on every install: the core, then the domain ontologies chosen, then the ontologies they declare as dependencies. An EXAMPLE for an oral-history + intangible-heritage installation \u2014 not the default:

\`\`\`bash
ACTIVE_ONTOLOGY_TLDS=[ "dd", "rsc", "ontology", "ontologytype", "hierarchy", "lg", "oh", "ich" ]
\`\`\`

!!! info "When the key is unset"
    The engine does NOT fall back to an empty list: it uses the core set
    \`dd, rsc, ontology, ontologytype, hierarchy, lg\`, and the update
    panel says so \u2014 it labels the reference list *Engine fallback (not configured)*
    instead of *Configured in this installation*. Domain TLDs (\`oh\`, \`ich\`, \`tch\`,
    \`numisdata\`, \`utoponymy\`, \`nexus\`, \u2026) are never in that fallback: they are
    per-installation, so set the key to add them. An installation that relied on the
    old fallback for \`utoponymy\` or \`nexus\` adds them to the key.

!!! note "Dependencies"
    An ontology may need nodes of other ontologies (\`tch\` uses models and terms of \`crm\`, \`tchi\`, \u2026). Those dependencies are DECLARED by the ontology server (its manifest lists them per TLD) and the installer installs them together with the chosen ontology. Thesaurus *hierarchies* are different: a \`tch\` installation still activates the \`material\`, \`technique\` or \`objects\` hierarchies itself, because hierarchies are created by the users. [See the table of dependencies](thesaurus_dependencies.md#dependencies).

!!! note "Applying changes in ACTIVE_ONTOLOGY_TLDS"
    Any change in \`ACTIVE_ONTOLOGY_TLDS\` will need a update of the ontology, this changes are not directly applied. Dédalo needs to get the ontology tld and install it, to do that update the ontology in [maintenance](../management/maintenance_status.md) control panel.

!!! note "Activities"
    The \`actv\` tld should be used as model to implement a virtual sections with more specific activities as hierarchies of toponymy does into the thesaurus using it as \`hierarchy20\`, the main section to implement in this way is \`actv1\` and his model \`actv2\`. The virtual sections should be defined with a prefix \`actv\` into the new tld, in this way:
    - for exhibitions section the tld could be: \`actvexhibition\`
    - for conferences section the tld could be: \`actvconference\``,

A request for "all" rows, for a negative number, or for more rows than this ceiling, all come back clamped to the ceiling — so no client can ask the server for an unbounded result set. Searches the server itself builds (exports, publications, counts) are not clamped and keep full access to the whole result.
