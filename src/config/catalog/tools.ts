		doc: `This parameter defines extra directories where Dédalo will look for tools, besides the \`tools/\` directory of the installation itself.

Tools kept outside the Dédalo directory survive an update of the code and can be versioned on their own, which is what an institution developing its own tools wants. Every entry is an object with a \`path\` (the directory on disk holding the tool packages) and a \`url\` (the address the web server publishes that directory at, because the browser loads the tool's own interface code from there). The url must be an address of THIS site — a full address pointing at another host is rejected — and serving the directory at that address is your job, not Dédalo's.

The list is empty by default. The installation's own \`tools/\` directory is always searched first and always wins a name collision, so an additional root can never quietly replace a tool that ships with Dédalo; a root that does not exist, is not a directory, or sits in a system temporary directory is refused and reported at boot.

		doc: `This parameter defines the directory holding the transform definition files — the JSON declarations that drive the \`move_*\` maintenance widgets (move a tipo, move a locator, move data into a portal or into a table, move a language).

A transformation of this kind is written down before it is run: the file lists, item by item, what is moved where. The widget reads the files of its own subdirectory (\`<dir>/move_tld/\`, \`<dir>/move_locator/\`, …) and offers them to the operator; only \`.json\` files sitting directly in that subdirectory are read, never a path that climbs out of it.

Unset, Dédalo reads them from \`transform_definition_files\` inside the private directory — OUTSIDE the code tree, because a code update replaces the whole install directory and your transformations are institution-specific data an update must not touch. An install that still keeps files at the legacy in-tree \`install/transform_definition_files\` location is not moved: while that directory holds files and this key is unset, it keeps being used. Point the key at a directory of your own to place them anywhere else.

The widget walks every tool directory, validates its declaration and compares it with the tool records stored in the ontology. With this parameter at its default \`false\`, that is all it does: it reports, per tool, whether it is valid and whether the registry already matches — and changes nothing. Set it to \`true\` and the same run reconciles the registry, creating or updating the record of each tool.

Leave it off in normal operation and turn it on for the moment you register a newly added tool. An installation that never adds tools of its own never needs it.

		doc: `This parameter defined how long, in milliseconds, the server kept the tools registry in memory before reading it from the database again.

It is no longer consulted. The expiry existed because a second engine could write the tools registry behind this server's back, so the cache had to be assumed stale after a while. Dédalo is now the only writer of those records, and every write clears the cache the moment it happens — so the data can never be stale and there is nothing to expire.

The key is still recognized, so an existing configuration carrying it still starts, but setting it has no effect and it can be removed.
