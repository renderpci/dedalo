it comes back up running the new code. That only works if **something restarts it**. To
avoid taking the server down for good, the update refuses to run unless the process was
started with \`DEDALO_SUPERVISED=true\`.

The key is **declared by the process manager that restarts the server**, never written into
the configuration file. Every shipped runtime definition already carries it: the reference
systemd unit (\`Environment=DEDALO_SUPERVISED=true\`), the Docker Compose stacks
(\`environment:\`), and the \`start:supervised\`, \`dev\` and \`dev:server\` scripts, which
relaunch the server when it asks for a restart. A unit or stack you wrote yourself needs the
same line.

A value in \`../private/.env\` is **ignored**: that file is read by every launch method,
including \`bun run start\`, which is deliberately unsupervised — nothing relaunches it. The
refusal names the ignored line when it finds one. Nor is supervision guessed from the service
manager's own variables: those are inherited by every process started under it, terminal
shells included.

Declaring \`true\` on a process that nothing restarts is the one dangerous mistake here:
the update will swap the code, exit, and the server will stay down until you start it
by hand.

its socket and answers \`/health\` until it is asked to stop. If it never answers, the update
is refused and nothing is swapped.

otherwise need a web server in front of every local checkout.

no per-record access control. A production install serves on the socket only, behind the

by the user the web server runs as — a socket neither can open is the usual cause of a
"bad gateway" that looks like the engine is down.

it **refuses to start** rather than quietly steal the running server's socket; a leftover

\`X-Forwarded-For\` is a request **header**: anything that can open a connection can write
it. It is trustworthy only because a proxy is known to have rewritten it — so it is read
on one transport and ignored on the other, and on the other the connection's own peer
address is used instead.

* \`socket\` (**default**) — the unix socket (\`SERVER_UNIX_SOCKET\`), which only the local
  reverse proxy can open. This is the documented production topology.
* \`tcp\` — a proxy really does stand in front of \`SERVER_TCP_PORT\`. Set this ONLY when
  that is true: on a port a browser reaches directly, it lets any client choose its own
  address.
* \`none\` — never read the header. Every request is attributed to its peer address.

Until 2026-08-24 the header was read on every listener, so on the direct TCP port a client
could pick the address used for the login throttle (a fresh brute-force bucket per
request), for \`dd544\` activity rows, and for any check that matches a literal loopback
address. The address is used for throttling and audit; the hop arithmetic is
\`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS\`.

the address it received the request from to the \`X-Forwarded-For\` header, so the genuine
client address is the entry this many positions **from the right**. Everything further to the
left was supplied by the caller and can be forged freely.

The engine uses that address for the login throttle and for audit records — never as an
authorization input. Set it to exactly the number of proxies that append the header; the
default \`1\` matches the standard single web server in front. Both mistakes hurt:

* **Too high** — you start trusting an entry the caller wrote. An attacker sends a new forged
  address on every attempt, gets a fresh login-throttle bucket each time, and the brute-force
  protection is gone.
* **Too low** — every request appears to come from your own proxy. All users share one throttle
  bucket, so one person's wrong passwords lock out everybody.

Your proxy must *append* rather than replace (in nginx,
\`proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\`), or the count is meaningless.
