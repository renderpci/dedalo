Areas are the top-level parts of the ontology (Thesaurus, Resources, Tools, …), each with its own tipo. A denied area is stripped from the ontology BEFORE the security layer runs, so it disappears from the menu and becomes unreachable — for every user, the root user included. Denial is absolute: there is no allow-list that can give it back.

By default Dédalo denies the areas that exist as internal lists of values rather than as places a user works in — the Yes/No list, for one — and those should stay denied. Add a tipo here to take a whole area out of an installation that does not use it. To hide an area from the menu while leaving it reachable, use MENU_SKIP_TIPOS instead. The maintenance area can also persist this list at runtime, and that override wins over the value set here.

The ontology sometimes defines a long hierarchy to reach the sections, and it can be convenient to remove some tipo from the menu to get to them more quickly. Add the tipo to the array to remove it from the menu.

It is EMPTY by default. The default used to carry four tipos, two of them belonging to specific installations' ontologies — menu shortcuts of one project applied to every project, in a key whose own example already showed an empty array. Declare the skips your own ontology needs.
