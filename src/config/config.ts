/**
 * Typed configuration catalog for the Dédalo TS server.
 *
 * This module plays the role the PHP config catalog (DEDALO_* constants) plays,
 * re-expressed as a frozen typed object built once at boot (spec §5).
 *
 * ENFORCED config rule (audit S2-21 — the honest version of the old "ONLY
 * module" claim, which the census falsified):
 *   - Raw `process.env` reads are BANNED outside src/config/ (tripwire:
 *     test/unit/config_env_tripwire.test.ts). The only exemptions are
 *     subprocess env passthrough (spawning children with the whole env) and
 *     the per-file deferred sites named in that tripwire's allowlist.
 *   - Every other module reads env through src/config/env.ts (`readEnv` /
 *     `requireEnv` / `envSnapshot`), which is what restores the documented
 *     precedence chain: real process env > ../private/.env.
 *   - This module is the PREFERRED typed home for boot-stable settings; a
 *     number of subsystems still read their keys via readEnv at call time
 *     (sessions/login, diffusion, RAG). Those shadow keys are being absorbed
 *     incrementally.
 *   - The KEY CENSUS is `src/config/catalog/` — one declaration per key (type,
 *     default, scope, operator prose), which GENERATES install/sample.env and
 *     docs/config/config.md and is gated byte-for-byte by config_docs_tripwire.
 *     (This header used to say the census "lives in ../private/sample.env,
 *     regenerated from source". Both halves were false: nothing regenerated it,
 *     and the file did not exist — the renderer was PHP machinery that was never
 *     ported at the cutover.)
 *
 * Multi-tenancy note: the PHP version routes one deployment to many databases
 * by entity (DEDALO_ENTITY → config_db routing). We start with a single-entity
 * config and keep `entity` in the shape so per-entity routing can be added in
 * the DB layer without changing call sites.
