/**
 * THE DATA LANGUAGES THIS INSTALLATION DECLARES (DATA-01/DATA-25).
 *
 * ONE SET, and it is the READ-REACHABLE one. The read fallback chain
 * (`core/resolve/component_data.ts`) iterates, in order: the requested lang, its
 * declared equivalents, `DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT`, `lg-nolan`, then
 * `DEDALO_PROJECTS_DEFAULT_LANGS`. A slice stored under any OTHER code is a
 * slice no read resolves through a language the install offers — the write
 * returned ok:true and the bytes became unreachable, which is the silent-loss
 * class this engine ranks above everything else. So the write chokepoint
 * (`core/section/record/save_component.ts`) admits exactly the codes that chain
 * can reach, and this module is where they are computed.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN `src/config/` AND NOT AT THE CHOKEPOINT. Every language key
 * is read here already, and the set has a SECOND consumer that cannot import the
 * chokepoint: `config.menu.dataLang` itself (see `resolveCurrentDataLang`). One
 * home, two doors — "link, never duplicate". It also keeps `src/core/` free of
 * the `config.menu` lang reads the P0-7 census ratchets down.
 *
 * A LEAF: it imports only the code grammar. `src/config/` may not import
 * `src/core/`, so `lg-nolan` is spelled here rather than imported from
 * `core/ontology/ontology_tipos.ts` — which imports config, so the import would
 * be a cycle. That leaves two spellings of the same token (three, counting the
 * local `NOLAN` in `core/resolve/component_data.ts`); the way to ONE is for
 * core's `DATA_NOLAN` to re-export this constant, exactly as
 * `core/concepts/ontology.ts` re-exports `LANG_PATTERN` from `./lang_code.ts`.
 * That edit belongs to the file that owns `DATA_NOLAN`, not here.

 * this file replaced, 2026-08-27) bought the engine a write language no read

 * was added to prevent. The outage that motivated the seeding is closed at the
 * other end instead — `resolveCurrentDataLang` below keeps the menu language
 * INSIDE this set, and `currentDataLang()` falls back to
 * `DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT` outside any request scope.
 *
 * `DEDALO_APPLICATION_LANGS` is not an input either: a UI language is not a data
 * language — an install may offer an interface in a language it does not
 * catalogue in — and admitting them would make the gate agree with a set no read
 * path consults.
 *
 * A pure function of an explicit source rather than a closure over `config`, so

/**
 * Resolve `DEDALO_DATA_LANG` — the install's CURRENT data language — against the

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `DEDALO_DATA_LANG` is a separate key from
 * `DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT` and nothing makes the two agree, yet the configured
 * value is what a session without a language choice writes in: dispatch seeds
 * the request-language scope with it, the client reads it back as
 * `page_globals.dedalo_data_lang`, and the save carries it. A value outside the
 * declared set therefore had exactly two possible fates, both bad — refused by
 * the write chokepoint (a total interactive write outage for every fresh
 * session), or admitted into a slice the read chain never reaches.
 *
 * So it is neither: an out-of-set value is OVERRULED by
 * `DEDALO_DATA_LANG_DEFAULT`, which is by construction both declared and the
 * read chain's first candidate. Nothing is stranded by the substitution — data
 * already stored under the overruled code was unreachable before it (the data
 * language SELECTOR only offers the project languages, and the fallback chain
 * never consults DEDALO_DATA_LANG), and the caller reports the fact with the
 * action that recovers it: add the language to DEDALO_PROJECTS_DEFAULT_LANGS.
 *
 * NOT A THROW. A fresh box is exactly this shape — install mode boots on
 * sentinels where PROJECTS_DEFAULT_LANGS is ['lg-eng'] and DATA_LANG is its
 * catalog default 'lg-spa' — so refusing the boot would refuse every new
 * installation. The precedent is one screen up in config.ts: DEDALO_DIFFUSION_LANGS
 * reports at boot and refuses at the point of use, because a server whose
 * editors are working must not die for a language-list mistake.
