/**
 * THE EXPORT'S EXTERNAL SOURCES — batch prefetch of remote rows, and the
 * record of every cell an external source could not fully answer.
 *
 * Two halves, both run-scoped (one instance per export — grid.ts builds them
 * in openExportGridInScope, never at module scope):
 *
 * 1. PREFETCH (FIX 5, 2026-09-24). A component_external cell has no stored
 *    value: its record IS a remote record (engineering/EXTERNAL_SPEC.md §3).
 *    The walk resolves records one at a time, so each external cell used to
 *    fetch its remote row LIVE, in series — the value derivation's per-cell
 *    fallback (component_external/value.ts fetchOwnRow). A 20k-record
 *    bibliography export was 20k sequential round trips to Zenon.
 *
 *    Now, before each hydrate batch is walked, the batch's external TARGETS
 *    are collected from the plan and the batch's stored locators, fetched in
 *    ONE `fetchExternalRows` call (merged by record, field sets unioned,
 *    coalesced with any concurrent reader, served from the row cache when
 *    fresh, and parallel only up to DEDALO_EXTERNAL_MAX_CONCURRENCY at the
 *    transport door — no unbounded fan-out), and PARKED in the run's emission
 *    scratch (value.ts setPrefetchedExternalRows). A cell then derives from
 *    the parked row and issues no request.
 *
 *    WHAT IS PREDICTED (ExternalPrefetchPlan). Per exported field:
 *      - a LEAF component_external — targets = the records the declared path
 *        reaches at the leaf (the root record itself, or through any number
 *        of relation hops: rsc368 → zenon3);
 *      - a RELATION leaf whose own request_config children include
 *        component_external — targets = the leaf's stored locators (the
 *        rsc368 compact / fan-out cell, whose zenon3..zenon11 children read
 *        each locator target).
 *    Deeper fan-out (a relation child of a relation leaf, dataframe frames)
 *    is not predicted: those cells take the per-cell fallback, as before.
 *    Only targets the component BELONGS to are collected
 *    (value.ts externalComponentAppliesTo — a local rsc205 target of the
 *    mixed rsc368 portal is never sent to Zenon).
 *
 *    A WRONG PREDICTION CANNOT CHANGE A VALUE — AND COSTS NO REQUEST. The row
 *    layer requests every record with its SECTION's record field set
 *    (src/external/record_fields.ts: the id field + every field any of the
 *    section's component_external nodes maps), whatever fields this plan
 *    predicted, and each parked view names the fields it was requested with;
 *    value.ts serves a parked row only to a component whose fields it covers.
 *    So the prefetch, the per-cell fallback and a read's portal prepass all
 *    share ONE cache entry per record: an unpredicted cell is a cache hit, not
 *    a second GET (2026-09-24, WC-2026-09-24-external-record-field-set). The
 *    prefetch is an optimisation, never a precondition, and a prefetch failure
 *    is loud and non-fatal (every cell re-derives).
 *
 *    UNDER THE EXPORT FRONTIER (2026-09-24). The prefetch runs AHEAD of the
 *    walk, so it applies the walk's own crossing answer
 *    (resolver.ts exportCrossingAllowed) at every crossing the walk will make:
 *    a hop into a record, with the component the next step reads through it,
 *    and each target of a relation leaf. A crossing the frontier refuses is
 *    NOT followed: its record's locators are not read, and no remote id found
 *    behind it is sent to the service (the walk then reaches the same crossing
 *    and applies the refusal law itself). Otherwise the service would learn
 *    which remote records a record the caller cannot read cites, before the
 *    export aborts. The prefetch EMITS nothing: every value that reaches the
 *    file is still produced by the walk.
 *
 *    BOUNDED AGAINST A SICK SERVICE, AND STOPPABLE. fetchExternalRows starts
 *    the batch's records a few at a time, so each meets the breaker's CURRENT
 *    verdict (an opened circuit refuses the rest without a socket), and the
 *    export's Stop signal is passed in: no further record is started once it
 *    fires.
 *
 * 2. DEGRADATION LOG (FIX 4, 2026-09-24). An export is a deliverable: a Zenon
 *    column left blank because the service was down (or the breaker open)
 *    must not look like "this record has no author". Every degraded
 *    component_external cell the walk resolves is reported here
 *    (relation_list.ts CellValueResolveOptions.onExternalDegraded) and the
 *    export exposes a LIVE, BOUNDED summary: counts per (service, state), the
 *    number of exported records affected, and a capped sample of
 *    (record, component, remote id). tool_export copies it into the job
 *    manifest and serves it (list / preview / terminal frame); the protocol's
 *    'end' line carries it when present (so the NDJSON file and the
 *    get_export_grid stream carry the marker too — absent, both are
 *    byte-identical to before).
 *
 *    WHICH STATES ARE RECORDED (value.ts ExternalSourceState):
 *      incomplete — the file lacks a value (or part of one) it should hold:
 *        unavailable, timeout, circuit_open   (retryable: re-run later)
 *        disabled, misconfigured              (an operator must act)
 *        truncated  ('ok' with dropped values — the emission ceilings cut it)
 *      outdated   — stale: the value IS there, from the last good copy
 *        (a refresh failed); recorded, but the export is not incomplete.
 *      NOT recorded — not_found: the service ANSWERED that the record is not
 *        there (a real, definitive answer, like an empty stored field); and a
 *        foreign target (the column does not apply to that record). A record
 *        endpoint that answers 4xx for EVERY id is not an answer: past a streak
 *        it reads as `unavailable` (src/external/record_answers.ts) and is
 *        recorded like any unread source.
 *    `missing_cells` / `missing_records` count only the cells with NO value
 *    from the source (incomplete minus truncated), so the tool can say how many
 *    values could not be read without counting stale or cut ones.
