/**
 * Format-writer contract (DIFFUSION_SPEC §4.3) — the boundary between the
 * resolution pipeline (plan × records → ProjectedRow/RecordIR) and target
 * I/O (MariaDB, files). Writers know NOTHING about ontology or resolution;
 * the pipeline knows nothing about SQL dialects or file layouts.
 *
 * Lifecycle per run: open(plan, context?) → ensureSchema() ONCE (serialized per
 * table; DDL auto-commits in MariaDB so it must never sit inside a row
 * transaction) → writeRows()/removeRecords() per committed batch (idempotent:
 * upserts by (section_id, lang); deletes tolerate missing tables), each
 * followed by takeArtifacts() + checkpoint() → close(context) (merges / zips /
 * marker union / counts) or abort() (releases the session's handles).
 *
 * A RUN OUTLIVES ITS SESSION (DIFF-1, WC-2026-09-30-diffusion-run-ledger). A
 * runner can die between two batches and a NEW session resumes the run; so
 * nothing the run's final artifacts depend on may live only in a session:
 *   - every per-record file a batch wrote or removed is reported as an
 *     ArtifactEvent (takeArtifacts) — the runner appends them to the job's run
 *     ledger in the batch's own transaction, and close() reads the run's
 *     MANIFEST back from it (WriterCloseContext);
 *   - checkpoint() is a durability barrier returning the session's resumable
 *     state (counters; a streamed file's byte offset, fsynced) — the runner
 *     commits it with the batch and hands it back to open() on resume, so the
 *     run summary counts the WHOLE run and a streamed snapshot continues where
 *     it was durable (`continuity`).
 * abort() never consolidates and never deletes a file it did not create in
 * that session: a target directory is shared with other sessions (DIFF-2).
