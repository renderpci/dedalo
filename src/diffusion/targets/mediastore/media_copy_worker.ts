/**
 * MEDIA COPY WORKER (PUBLICATION_HOST_SPEC §5.2, decisions M3/M4): the in-process,
 * per-host SERIALIZED lane between the pub/ transition seam (and every other copy
 * caller) and the copy apply.
 *
 *  - Unpublish (`published:false`) is flushed on the next microtask, to every host,
 *    three ways: (1) AT ONCE, outside the lane (deps.withdrawNow → media_copy_apply.ts
 *    withdrawNowWith: recorded pending, `media.mark false`), never behind a running unit;
 *    (2) into the host's PRE-EMPT set, which the round running there drains before its
 *    next unit (ApplyOptions.takeWithdrawn: drops the key from the round's known markers,
 *    withdraws again); (3) into the queued sync (withdraw-only pass first, then the plan
 *    deletes the files and verifies). Publish is debounced (PUBLISH_DEBOUNCE_MS): one
 *    planning walk.
 *  - THE LATENCY BOUND of a withdrawal (M2) is path (1)'s, independent of any transfer:
 *    after the flip, one status read (hostTakesCopy; AGENT_TIMEOUTS_MS.read, plus the
 *    pairing proof's AGENT_TIMEOUTS_MS.health when not yet proved) and one runtime write,
 *    then the `mark false` (AGENT_TIMEOUTS_MS.media); the keys of one flush go in order,
 *    each after the previous answered. Without withdrawNow the bound would be the next
 *    unit boundary — after the running unit, i.e. a whole put (its hash on a cache miss
 *    plus a transfer of up to mediaPutDeadlineMs(size)), which is why it is wired at boot.
 *  - Per host: ONE run at a time, and at most ONE queued sync, which absorbs every
 *    transition arriving meanwhile (its withdrawn keys merge). Hosts never wait on
 *    each other. A failed run is logged; the lane goes on.
 *  - ONE LANE FOR EVERY CALLER: `exclusive(host, work)` / `inMediaCopyLane` chain
 *    arbitrary work (the media_copy reconcile's plan → apply → re-plan, the widget's
 *    round) onto the same tail, so no caller applies a stale plan beside a hook run.
 *  - In-process only: a long AV transfer must not hold a diffusion runner slot.
 *    Cross-process ordering is the advisory target lock each unit takes
 *    (media_copy_apply.ts, `media:<host>`; held for control calls only, never a
 *    transfer); an immediate withdrawal takes none (see withdrawNowWith).
 *  - DETACHED FROM THE WRITER'S TRANSACTION. A flip is emitted from inside a marker
 *    writer's transaction (a runner batch's fenced unit, the fenced media_index
 *    reconcile), and a timer or microtask scheduled there inherits its async context.
 *    A run is background work that outlives that writer (its handle expires at COMMIT),
 *    so the sink, every immediate withdrawal and every queued run leave the transaction
 *    context (runDetachedFromTransaction) — a run never joins, or outlives, a batch's
 *    transaction. So does every `exclusive` / `inMediaCopyLane` unit, worker or not.
 *    Each layer is pinned on its own (media_copy_worker_native "detach layer").
 *
 * Correctness does not depend on this worker: the media_copy reconcile recomputes
 * from ground truth whatever it missed (a registry it could not read, a crash).
 * Lanes and queues are INSTANCE state; the one module binding is `activeWorker`.
