/**
 * Durable diffusion job queue (DIFFUSION_SPEC §4.2, DIFFUSION_PLAN D3-P0).
 *
 * The single Postgres-backed source of truth for diffusion runs. The main
 * server ENQUEUES and OBSERVES; a spawned runner process CLAIMS and EXECUTES.
 * The two sides share nothing but these rows — that is what makes runner
 * placement (local spawn vs separate machine) a deployment choice, keeps a
 * run alive across browser disconnects and server restarts, and lets any
 * server instance stream any run's progress.
 *
 * Identity model (pinned fixtures test/parity/fixtures/diffusion/pinned.ts):
 * - `job_id` (server UUID) is the durable capability — internal only.
 * - `client_process_id` is the copied client's deterministic label
 *   ('process_diffusion_{user}_{element}_{section}') — the CLIENT-FACING
 *   process_id in every wire payload. Authorization is NEVER by id knowledge:
 *   status/cancel are owner-scoped (or global admin).
 *
 * All timing math uses the DB clock (single clock); JS Date appears only in
 * the SSE projection layer (sse.ts) where the client expects epoch ms. A
 * LIVENESS stamp (`heartbeat_at`, the terminal `finished_at`) is the WALL clock
 * (`clock_timestamp()`), never `now()`: `now()` is the TRANSACTION START, and
 * since DIFF-2 the progress/checkpoint/finish writes ride the runner's fenced
 * unit — a `now()` there would set the heartbeat BACK to when a long unit
 * began, overwriting the interval heartbeat's fresher stamp, and the sweeper
 * (its KEY SHARE gone at commit) would revoke a live runner. Gate:
 * diffusion_target_fence_native "liveness stamps".
 *
 * LEASE MODEL (PUB-13, WC-2026-09-05-diffusion-lease-epoch-fence). A row can be
 * claimed more than once: the sweeper requeues a stale-heartbeat run and a later
 * claim hands it to a NEW runner. `attempt` is incremented inside the claim
 * statement and `(job_id, attempt)` is the per-claim EPOCH — the lease. Every
 * write a lease-holder makes carries it and is fenced with
 * `AND attempt = $epoch AND state = 'running'`; zero rows affected means the
 * lease was revoked and the caller throws `diffusion.lease_revoked` WITHOUT
 * writing. Reads are never fenced.
 *
 * `attempt` IS STRICTLY MONOTONIC FOR THE LIFE OF THE ROW — the claim is the
 * ONLY statement that assigns it, and only as `attempt + 1`. Nothing lowers or
 * resets it, because an epoch that can be RE-ISSUED is not an epoch: a reset
 * hands epoch 1 to a second claim while a slow-but-alive runner from the first
 * claim still holds epoch 1, and both fence legs then match for the loser (an
 * ABA on the counter — the defect this model exists to close). The retry BUDGET
 * is therefore carried by `max_attempts`, never by rewinding the epoch: the
 * admin requeue extends the budget (`max_attempts = attempt + N`) and leaves
 * the counter alone. Gate: `queue_fence_tripwire` (census of every assignment
 * to `attempt`) + `queue_fence_native` (the ABA is built and refused).
 *
 * The only unfenced writers are the control plane's own: the claim (which
 * ISSUES the epoch), the sweeper (which REVOKES it), the owner-scoped cancel
 * flag, the queued-row finalizer and the admin requeue — each state-guarded on
 * its own terms and enumerated in `queue_fence_tripwire` (which also censuses
 * the job-scoped run ledger, jobs/run_ledger.ts, on the same epoch).
 *
 * THE TARGET FENCE (DIFF-2). The epoch fences the job ROW; the runner's writes
 * to its publication TARGET are fenced by jobs/target_fence.ts: each batch is
 * one transaction holding the target's advisory lock and the job row `FOR KEY
 * SHARE` on the lease. The sweeper takes stale rows `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
 * so a runner inside a batch is never revoked; heartbeat, progress and the
 * cancel flag (plain UPDATEs, NO KEY UPDATE) never wait on a batch.
 *
 * ATTACH IS OWNER-SCOPED (DIFF-3). One ACTIVE run per (element, section) — the
 * partial unique index — and a second request attaches only when it is the
 * same owner's identical run; otherwise `diffusion.target_busy` (409).
