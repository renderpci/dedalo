/**
 * Diffusion scheduler — the control plane's job dispatcher (DIFFUSION_SPEC §4.2).
 *
 * Claims queued jobs (bounded by DEDALO_DIFFUSION_MAX_RUNNERS, default 2) and
 * spawns one RUNNER PROCESS per claim: `bun run src/diffusion/runner.ts --job
 * <uuid>` — same codebase, separate process, own memory ceiling, killable.
 * The runner talks only to Postgres (and later the publication targets), so a
 * runner daemon on another machine claiming from the same queue needs no code
 * change — this local spawner is just the default deployment.
 *
 * Also hosts the SWEEPER cadence: at boot and on an interval, stale-heartbeat
 * running jobs are re-queued (attempt budget) or failed — the crash-recovery
 * path a durable queue exists for.
