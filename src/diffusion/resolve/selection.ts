/**
 * Selection — keyset-batched record cursor + batched matrix reads
 * (DIFFUSION_SPEC §4.1 stage C, DIFFUSION_PLAN D3-P1).
 *
 * Records are selected through the SAME assembler every other read uses
 * (buildSearchSql over the sanitized SQO — spec §8.4), then paginated by
 * KEYSET (WHERE section_id > cursor ORDER BY section_id LIMIT batch): never
 * OFFSET, so a resumed run re-selects exactly the remaining slice and a batch
 * boundary is a durable checkpoint (the section_id cursor in the job row).
 *
 * readMatrixRecords is the batched twin of core readMatrixRecord (one IN
 * query per batch, spec §4.1 "retire per-record loops") — it lives HERE, not
 * in core/db, because bulk publication reads are a diffusion concern; the
 * projection and allowlist gates are identical to the core reader.
