# V5 Ontology editor

Since DÃ©dalo was rebuilt with his ontology introduced in v4, this has been the interface of the editor. At the begin was a fork of the v3 thesaurus code and it was adapted to manage the terms and connections between nodes.
Now this tech is totally obsolete and it was removed from the main branch. This code is obsolete and we recommend do not use it. But, it's working (last tests was in 6.2.9 and 6.3.0)and can be used if you want or you need it.
